<p>The texts of most pictured Marks will appear in plain type if you
hover your mouse over the picture. Expanded abbreviations are shown in

<h3><a name = "preface" id = "preface">PREFACE.</a></h3>

<p><img src = "images/capT.png" width = "67" height = "67"
alt = "T" align = "left">HERE are few phases of typography open to the
charge of being neglected. An unquestionable exception occurs, however,
in relation to Printers’ Marks. This subject is in many respects one of
the most interesting in connection with the early printers, who, using
devices at first purely as trade marks for the protection of their books
against the pirate, soon began to discern their ornamental value, and,
consequently, employed the best available artists to design them. Many
of these examples are of the greatest bibliographical and general
interest, as well as of considerable value in supplementing an important
class of illustrations to the printed books, and showing the origin of
several typical classes of Book-plates (Ex-Libris). The present Handbook
has been written with a view to supplying a readable but accurate
account of this neglected chapter in the history of art and
bibliography; and it appeals with equal force to the artist or
collector. Only one book on the subject, Berjeau’s “Early Dutch, German,
and English Printers’ Marks,” has appeared in this
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
<a name = "pageviii" id = "pageviii"> </a>
country, and this, besides being out of print and expensive, is
destitute of descriptive letterpress. The principle which determined the
selection of the illustrations is of a threefold character: first, the
importance of the printer; secondly, the artistic value or interest of
the Mark itself; and thirdly, the geographical importance of the city or
town in which the Mark first appeared.</p>

<p>Since the text of this book was printed, however, two additions have
been made to the literature of its subject: Dr. Paul Kristeller’s “Die
Italienischen Buchdrucker- und Verlegerzeichen, bis 1525,” a&nbsp;very
handsome work, worthy to rank with the “Elsässische Büchermarken bis
Anfang des 18. Jahrhunderts” of Herr Paul Heitz and Dr. Karl
A.&nbsp;Barack (to whom I am indebted for much valuable information as
well as for nearly thirty illustrations in the chapter on German
Printers’ Marks); and Mr. Alfred Pollard’s “Early Illustrated Books,” an
admirable volume which, however, only deals incidentally with the
Printer’s Mark as a side issue in the history of the decoration and
illustration of books in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Mr.
Pollard reproduces seven blocks from Dr. Kristeller’s monograph on the
Devices of the Italian Printers. In reference to the statement on
<a href = "#page116">p.&nbsp;116</a> of this volume that the Mark of Bade
“is the earliest picture of a printing press,” Mr. Pollard refers to an
unique copy of an edition of the “Danse Macabre” printed anonymously at
Lyons in February, 1499, eight years earlier, which contains cuts of the
shops of a printer and a bookseller.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
<a name = "pageix" id = "pageix"> </a>

<p>That this volume has considerably exceeded its intended limit must be
my excuse for not including, with a very few exceptions, any modern
examples from the Continent. Nearly every French printer and publisher
of any note indulges in the luxury of a Mark of some sort, and an
interesting volume might be written concerning modern continental
examples. The practice of using a Printer’s Mark is an extremely
commendable one, not merely as a relic of antiquity, but from an
æsthetic point of view. Nearly every tradesman of importance in this
country has some sort of trade mark; but most printers agree in
regarding it as a wholly unnecessary superfluity. As the few exceptions
indicated in the last chapter prove that the fashion has an artistic as
well as a utilitarian side, I&nbsp;hope that it will again become more
general as time goes&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>As regards my authorities: I have freely availed myself of nearly all
the works named in the “Bibliography” at the end, besides such
invaluable works as Brunet’s “Manual,” Mr. Quaritch’s Catalogues, and
the monographs on the various printers, Plantin, Elzevir, Aldus, and the
rest. From Messrs. Dickson and Edmonds’ “Annals of Scottish Printing”
I&nbsp;have obtained not only some useful information regarding the
Printer’s Mark in Scotland, but, through the courtesy of Messrs.
Macmillan and Bowes of Cambridge, the loan of several blocks from the
foregoing work, as well as that of John Siberch, the first Cambridge
printer. I&nbsp;have also to thank M.&nbsp;Martinus Nijhoff, of the
Hague, Herr Karl W.&nbsp;Hiersemann, of Leipzig, Herr J.&nbsp;H.
<span class = "pagenum">x</span>
<a name = "pagex" id = "pagex"> </a>
Ed. Heitz, Strassburg, Mr. Elliot Stock, Mr. Robert Hilton, Editor of
the “British Printer,” and the Editor of the “American Bookmaker,” for
the loan either of blocks or of original examples of Printers’ Marks;
and Mr. C.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;Jacobi for several useful works on typography.
Mr. G.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Johnston, of Edinburgh, kindly lent me the reduced
facsimile on <a href = "#fig252">p.&nbsp;252</a>, which arrived too late
to be included in its proper place. The publishers whose Marks are
included in the chapter on “Modern Examples” are also thanked for the
courtesy and readiness with which they placed electros at my
disposal.</p>

<p>The original idea of this book is due to my friend, Mr. Gleeson
White, the general editor of the series in which it appears; but my
thanks are especially due to Mr. G.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Dennis for the great
care with which he has gone through the whole work.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Shorn</span>
of all the romance and glamour which seem inevitably to surround every
early phase of typographic art, a&nbsp;Printer’s Device may be described
as nothing more or less than a trade mark. It is usually a sufficient
proof that the book in which it occurs is the work of a particular
craftsman. Its origin is essentially unromantic, and its employment, in
the earlier stages of its history at all events, was merely an attempt
to prevent the inevitable pirate from reaping where he had not sown. At
one time a copy, or more correctly a forgery, of a Printer’s Mark could
be detected with comparative ease, even if the body of the book had all
the appearance of genuineness.</p>

<p>This self-protection was necessary on many grounds. First of all, the
privileges of impression
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
<a name = "page2" id = "page2"> </a>
which were granted by kings, princes, and supreme pontiffs, were usually
obtained only by circuitous routes and after the expenditure of much
time and money. Moreover, the counterfeit book was rarely either
typographically or textually correct, and was more often than not
abridged and mutilated almost beyond recognition, to the serious
detriment of the printer whose name appeared on the title-page. Places
as well as individualities suffered, for very many books were sold as
printed in Venice, without having the least claim to that distinction.
The Lyons printers were most unblushing sinners in this respect, and
Renouard cites a Memorial drawn up by Aldus himself on the subject, and
published at Venice in 1503.</p>

<p>But apart from the foregoing reasons, it must be remembered that many
of the earliest monuments of typographic art appeared not only without
the name of the printer but also without that of the locality in which
they were printed. Although in such cases various extraneous
circumstances have enabled bibliographers to “place” these books, the
Mark of the printer has almost invariably been the chief aid in this
direction. The Psalter of 1457 is the first book which has the name of
the place where it was printed, besides that of the printers as well as
the date of the year in which it was executed. But for a long time after
that date books appeared without one or the other of these attributes,
and sometimes without either, so that the importance of the Printer’s
Mark holds good.</p>

<p>A very natural question now suggests itself, “Who invented these
Marks?” Laire, “Index
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<a name = "page3" id = "page3"> </a>
Librorum” (Sæc. xv.), ii. 146, in speaking of a Greek Psalter says:
“<i>Habet signaturas, registrum ac custodes, sed non numerantur folia.
Litteræ principales ligno incisæ sunt, sicut et in principio cujuslibet
psalmi viticulæ quæ gallicé </i>vignettes<i> appellantur, quarum usum
primus excogitavit Aldus.</i><ins class = "correction" title = "close quote missing">” </ins>The volume here described was printed about 1495,
and the invention therefore has been very generally attributed to Aldus.
That this is not so will be shown in the next chapter. We shall confine
ourselves for the present to some of the various points which appear to
be material to a proper understanding of the subject.</p>

<p>One of the most important and interesting phases in connection with
Printers’ Marks is undoubtedly the <i>motif</i> of the pictorial
embellishment. Both the precise origin and the object of many Marks are
now lost to us, and many others are only explained after a thorough
study of the life of the particular printer or the nature of the books
which he generally printed or published. The majority, however, carry
their own <i>prima facie</i> explanations. The number of “punning”
devices is very large, and nearly every one has a character peculiarly
its own. Their antiquity is proved by the fact that before the beginning
of the fifteenth century, a&nbsp;picture of St. Anthony was boldly, not
to say irreverently, used by Antoine Caillaut, Paris. A&nbsp;long series
of punning devices occur in the books printed by or for the fifteenth
century publishers, one of the most striking and successful is that of
Michel le Noir, whose shield carries his initials, surmounted by the
head of a
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<a name = "page4" id = "page4"> </a>
negress and sometimes supported by canting figures in full. This Mark,
with variations, was also employed by Philippe and Guillaume le Noir,
the work of the three men covering a period of nearly 100 years. The
device of Gilles or Gillet Couteau, Paris, 1492, is apparently a double
pun, first on his Christian name, the transition from which to
<i>œillet</i> being easy and explaining the presence of a pink in
flower, and secondly on his surname by the three open knives, in one of
which the end of the blade is broken. It was almost inevitable that both
Denis Roce or Ross, a&nbsp;Paris bookseller, 1490, and Germain Rose, of
Lyons, 1538, should employ a rose in their marks,
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<a name = "page5" id = "page5"> </a>
and this they did, one of the latter’s examples having a dolphin twining
around the stem. Jacques and Estienne Maillet, whose works at Lyons
extended from the last eleven years of the fifteenth century to the
middle of the sixteenth, give in the centre of their shield a picture of
a mallet.</p>

employed by Galliot Du Pré, Paris, and in this we have a picture of a
galley propelled with the aid of sails and oars, and with the motto
“Vogue la gualee.” This device (with
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
<a name = "page6" id = "page6"> </a>
several variations) was used by both father and son, and possesses an
interest beyond the subject of Printers’ Marks, for it gives us a very
clear idea of the different boats employed during the first three
quarters of the sixteenth century. Another striking Mark of about the
same time and covering as nearly as possible the same period, was that
of the family De La Porte. The earlier example used in Paris about 1508
was a simple doorway; but the elder Hugues de la Porte, Lyons, and the
successors of Aymon De La Porte of the same place, used several
exceedingly bold designs in which Samson is represented carrying away
the gates of Gaza, the motto on one door or gate being “libertatem
meam,” and on the other “mecum porto.” The two printers of the same
name, Jehan Lecoq, who were practising the art continuously during
nearly the whole of the sixteenth century at Troyes, employed a Mark on
the shield of which appears the figure of a cock; whilst an equally
appropriate if much more ugly design, was employed by the eminent Lyons
family of Sébastien Gryphe or Gryphius: he had at least eight “griffin”
Marks, which differed slightly from one another. François Gryphe, who
worked in Paris, had one Mark which was original to the extent of the
griffin being supported by a tortoise. J.&nbsp;Du Moulin, Rouen,
employed a little picture of a windmill on his Mark, as did Scotland’s
first printer, Andro Myllar; but Jehan Petit, a&nbsp;prolific fifteenth
century printer of Paris, confined his punning to the words “Petit à
Petit,” as is seen in the reduced facsimile title, given on <a href =
"#fig9">p.&nbsp;9</a>, of a
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<a name = "page7" id = "page7"> </a>
book printed by him for T.&nbsp;Kerver. Mathias Apiarius, Strassburg,
used at least two Marks expressing the same idea, namely, a&nbsp;bear
discovering a bee’s nest in the hollow of a tree&mdash;an obvious pun on
his surname. The latter part of the sixteenth century is not nearly so
fruitful in really good or striking devices. Guillaume Bichon, Paris,
employed a realistic picture of a lap-dog (in allusion to his surname)
chasing a hare, with the motto “Nunc fugiens, olim pugnabo”; and equally
realistic in another way is the Mark of P.&nbsp;Chandelier, Caen, in
which effective use is made of a candle-stick with seven holders, the
motto being “Lucernis
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<a name = "page8" id = "page8"> </a>
fideliter ministro.” Antoine Tardif, Lyons, employed the Aldine anchor
and dolphin, and also a motto, “Festina tarde,” which is identical in
meaning, if not in the exact words, of that of Aldus. Guillaume De La
Rivière, Arras, used a charmingly vivid little scene of a winding river,
with the motto “Madenta flumine valles”; and it is not difficult to
distinguish the appropriateness of the sprig of barley in the Mark of
Hugues Barbon, Limoges. The Mark of Jacques Du Puys, Paris, was possibly
suggested by the word <i>puits</i> (or well), and of which Puys is
perhaps only a form: the picture at all events is a representation of
Christ at the well. In the case of Adam Du Mont, Orange, the christian
name, is “taken off” in a picture of Adam and Eve at the tree of
forbidden fruit; and exactly the same idea occurs with equal
appropriateness in the Mark of N.&nbsp;Eve, Paris, the sign of whose
shop was Adam and Eve. Michel Jove naturally went to profane history for
the subject of his Mark, and with a considerable amount of success.</p>

<p>Among the numerous other examples with mottoes derived from sacred
history, special mention, as showing the connection between the sign of
the shop and its incorporation in the Mark, may be made to the following
printers of Paris: D.&nbsp;De La Noue, who not only had “Jesus” as the
sign of his shop, but also as his Mark; J.&nbsp;Gueffier had the
“Amateur Divin” as his sign, and an allegorical interpretation of the
device, “Fert tacitus, vivit, vincit divinus amator,” as a Mark;
Guillaume Julian, or Julien, had “Amitie”
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
<a name = "page10" id = "page10"> </a>
as his sign, and a personification of this (Typus Amicitiæ) as his Mark,
with the motto “Nil Deus hac nobis majus concessit in usus”; Abel
L’Angelier (and his widow after his death) adopted the sacrifice of Abel
as the subject of his Sign and Mark, with the motto “Sacrum pinque dabo
nec macrum sacrificabo”; and the motto of both the first and the second
Michel Sonnius was “Si Deus pro nobis, quis contra nos?”</p>

<p>A few punning devices occur among the early English printers, but
they are not always clever or pictorially successful. The earliest
example is that of Richard Grafton, whose pretty device represents a tun
with a grafted tree growing through it, the motto, “Suscipite insertum
verbum,” being taken from the Epistle to St. James
(i.,&nbsp;verse&nbsp;21). John Day’s device, with the motto “Arise! for
it is day,” is generally supposed to be an allusion to the Reformation
as well as a pun on his name; tradition has it, however, that Day was
accustomed to awake his apprentices, when they had prolonged their
slumbers beyond the usual hour, by the wholesome application of a
scourge and the summons “Arise! for it is day.” We may also mention the
devices of Hugh Singleton, a&nbsp;single tun; and of W.&nbsp;Middleton,
a&nbsp;tun with the letter W at bottom and M in the centre of the tun;
of T.&nbsp;Pavier, in which, appropriately enough, we have a pavior
paving the streets of a town, and surrounded by the motto “Thou shalt
labour till thou return to dust.” Thomas Woodcock employed a device of a
cock on a stake, piled as for a Roman funeral, with the motto “Cantabo
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>

<p>Although not in any sense of a “punning” nature, the employment of a
printing press as a Mark may conveniently be here referred to. It was
first used in this manner, and in more than one form, by Josse Bade, or
Badius, an eminent printer of the first thirty-five years of the
sixteenth century, and to whom full reference will be found in the
chapter on French Marks. A&nbsp;Flemish printer, Pierre César, Ghent,
1516, was apparently the next to employ this device; then came Jehan
Baudouyn, Rennes, 1524; Eloy Gibier, Orleans, 1556; Jean Le Preux, Paris
and Switzerland, 1561; Enguilbert (II.) De Marnef and the Bouchets
brothers, Poitiers, 1567; and, later than all, L.&nbsp;Cloquemin, Lyons,
1579.</p>

<p>Next to the section of “punning” devices, perhaps the most
entertaining is that which deals with the question of mottoes. These are
derived from an infinite variety of sources, not infrequently from the
fertile brains of the printers themselves. Their application is not
always clear, but they are nearly always indicative of the virility
which characterized the old printers. It is neither desirable nor
possible to exhaust this somewhat intricate phase of the subject, but it
will be necessary to quote a few representative examples. Occasionally
we get a snatch of verse, as in the case of Michel Le Noir, whose motto
runs thus:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“C’est mon désir</p>
<p>De Dieu servir</p>
<p>Pour acquérir</p>
<p>Son doux plaisir.”</p>
</div>

<p>Also in the instance of another early printer, Gilles De Gourmont,
who chants&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Tost ou tard</p>
<p>Pres ou loing</p>
<p>A le Fort</p>
<p>Du feble besoing.”</p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the greatest number of all are those in which the printer
proclaims his faith to God and his loyalty to his king. One of the early
Paris printers enjoins us&mdash;in verse&mdash;not only to honour the
king and the court, but claims our salutations for the University; and
almost precisely the same sentiment finds expression in the Mark of
J.&nbsp;Alexandre, another early printer of Paris. Robinet or Robert
Macé, Rouen, proclaims “Ung dieu,
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
<a name = "page14" id = "page14"> </a>
ung roy, ung foy, ung loy,” and the same idea expressed in identical
words is not uncommonly met with in Printers’ Marks. Of a more
definitely religious nature are those, for example, of P.&nbsp;de
Sartières, Bourges, “Tout se passe fors dieu”; of J.&nbsp;Lambert,
“A&nbsp;espoir en dieu”; of Prigent Calvarin, “Deum time, pauperes
sustine, finem respice”; and several from the Psalms, such as that of
C.&nbsp;Nourry, called Le Prince, “Cor contritum et humiliatum deus non
despicies”; of P.&nbsp;De Saincte-Lucie, also called Le Prince, “Oculi
mei semper ad dominum”; and of J.&nbsp;Temporal (all three Lyons
printers), “Tangit montes et fumigant,” in which the design is quite in
keeping with the motto; in one case at least, S.&nbsp;Nivelle, one of
the commandments is made use of, “Honora patrem tuum, et matrem tuam, ut
sis longævus super terram.” Here, too, we may include the mottoes of
B.&nbsp;Rigaud, “A&nbsp;foy entiere cœur volant”; S.&nbsp;De Colines,
“Eripiam et glorificabo eum”; and of Benoist Bounyn, Lyons, “Labores
manum tuarum quia manducabis beatus es et bene tibi erit.” Whilst as a
few illustrations of a general character we may quote Geoffrey Tory’s
exceedingly brief “Non plus,” which was contemporaneously used also by
Olivier Mallard; J.&nbsp;Longis, “Nihil in charitate violentia”; Denys
Janot, “Tout par amour, amour par tout, par tout amour, en tout bien”;
the French rendering of a very old proverb in the mottoes of
B.&nbsp;Aubri and D.&nbsp;Roce, “A&nbsp;l’aventure tout vient a point
qui peut attendre”; J.&nbsp;Bignon, “Repos sans fin, sans fin repos”;
the motto used conjointly by M.&nbsp;Fézandat and R.&nbsp;Granjon, “Ne
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
<a name = "page16" id = "page16"> </a>
la mort, ne le venin”; and the motto of Etienne Dolet, “Scabra et
impolita ad amussim dolo, atque perfolio.” Among the mottoes of early
English printers, the most notable, partly for its dual source, and as
one of our earliest examples, is that of William Faques; one sentence,
“Melius est modicum justo super divitias peccatorum multas,” is taken
from Psalm xxxvii. verse 16; and the second, “Melior est patiens viro
forti, et qui dominat,” comes from Proverbs xvi., verse 32. The motto of
Richard Grafton has already been quoted; that of John Reynes was
“Redemptoris mundi arma”; and John Wolfe, “Vbique floret.”</p>

<p>The employment of mottoes in Greek and
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<a name = "page17" id = "page17"> </a>
Hebrew characters is a not unimportant feature in the earlier examples
of Printers’ Marks, but it must suffice us here to indicate a few of the
leading printers who used either one or the other, and sometimes both.
B.&nbsp;Rembolt was one of the earliest to incorporate a Greek phrase;
De Salenson, Ghent, had a Greco-Latin motto on an open bible, which is
the <i>pièce de resistance</i> of a pretty Mark, a&nbsp;similar idea
occurring in the totally different Marks of the brothers Treschel,
Lyons; another Lyons firm of printers, the brothers Huguetan, employed a
Greek motto, and a phrase, also in Greek characters, occurs in one of
the Marks of Peter Vidoue. The more notable Marks which contain Hebrew
characters, which generally signify Jehovah, are those of Joannes
Knoblouchus, or Knoblouch, Strassburg, in which we have not only Hebrew,
but upper and lower case Greek, and a Latin quotation&mdash;“Verum, quum
latebris delituit diu, emergit”; and of Wolfius Cæphalæus, also of
Strassburg; and here again we have the Mark environed by quotations in
Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. In a few instances we have the unlucky letter
of the Greek alphabet&mdash;<i>theta</i>&mdash;forming a Mark with
considerable originality, as in that of Guillaume Morel, where this
symbol of death is surrounded by two dragon serpents representing
immortality. The <i>theta</i> was also employed by Etienne
Prevosteau.</p>

<p>The subject of the sphere in Printers’ Marks might profitably occupy
a good deal of space in discussing. It is generally considered to be not
only the peculiar property of the Elzevirs, but that books
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<a name = "page18" id = "page18"> </a>
possessing it without having one or other of the real or assumed
imprints of this celebrated family of printers are impudent frauds. But
as a matter of fact, it was used by at least half-a-dozen printers many
years before the Elzevirs started printing. For example, it was employed
during the last decade of the fifteenth century by Gilles Hardouyn, and
early in the sixteenth by Huguetan brothers at Lyons, by P.&nbsp;Sergent
and L.&nbsp;Grandin at Paris, by J.&nbsp;Steels, or Steelsius of
Antwerp, and P.&nbsp;Lichtenstein of Venice. In these instances,
however, it is endowed, so to speak, with accessories. In the earliest
Mark it plays only an incidental part, but in the Huguetan example it
forms the device itself: it is held by a hand and is encircled by a ring
on which the owner of the hand is evidently trying to balance a ball;
there is a Greek motto. In a later and slightly different design of the
same family, the motto is altered in position, and is in Latin:
“Vniversitas rerum, vt Pvlis, in manv Iehovae.” Each of the two Paris
examples is remarkable in its peculiar way. In Grandin’s two Marks the
same allegorical idea prevails, viz., one person seizing a complete
sphere from an angel out of the clouds, apparently to exchange it for
the broken one held by a second person: in the cruder of the two
examples of these there is a quotation from the 117th Psalm. In
Sergent’s bold and vigorous Mark, the sphere, which incloses a figure of
the crucified Christ, is fixed into the top of a dead trunk of a tree.
It may also be mentioned that this device was frequently used by
printers during the middle and latter part of the seventeenth
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<a name = "page19" id = "page19"> </a>
century in this country&mdash;it appears, for example, on several books
printed by R.&nbsp;Bentley, London, during that period. The sphere as an
Elzevir Mark will be referred to in the chapter dealing with Dutch
examples.</p>

<p>An element which may be generically termed religious plays no
unimportant part in this subject. It will not be necessary to enter
deeply into the motives which induced so many of the old printers and
booksellers to select either their devices or the illustrations of their
Marks from biblical sources; and it must suffice to say that, if the
object is frequently hidden to us to-day, the fact of the extent of
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<a name = "page20" id = "page20"> </a>
their employment cannot be controverted. The incident of the Brazen
Serpent (Numbers xxi.) was a very popular subject. One of the earliest
to use it was Conrad Neobar, Paris, 1538; it was adopted by Reginald
Wolfe, who commenced printing in this country about 1543, and its
possession was considered of sufficient importance to merit special
mention among the goods bequeathed by his widow to her son Robert. It
was also the Mark of Wolfe’s contemporaries, Martin Le Jeune, Paris,
Jean Bien-Né, of the same city, and of Jean Crespin, Geneva, the
last-named using it in several sizes, in which the foot of the cross is
“continued” into an anchor. Apart from crosses in an infinite variety of
forms, and to which reference will presently be made, by far the most
popular form of religious devices consisted of what may, for convenience
sake, be termed angelic. Pictorially they are nearly always failures,
and often ludicrously so. The same indeed might be said of the work of
most artists who have essayed the impossible in this direction. An
extraordinary solemnity of countenance, a&nbsp;painful sameness and
extreme ugliness, are the three dominant features of the angels of the
Printers’ Mark. The subject offers but little scope for an artist’s
ingenuity it is true, and it is only in a very few exceptions that a
tolerable example presents itself. Their most frequent occurrence is in
supporting a shield with the national emblem of France, and in at least
one instance&mdash;that of André Bocard, Paris,&mdash;with the emblems
of the city and the University of Paris. This idea, without the two
latter emblems, occurs in
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
<a name = "page21" id = "page21"> </a>
the devices of Jehan Trepperel, Anthoine Denidel, and J.&nbsp;Bouyer and
G.&nbsp;Bouchet (who adopted it conjointly), who were printing or
selling books in Paris during the last decade of the fifteenth century;
whilst in the provinces in that period it was employed by Jacques Le
Forestier, at Rouen; and by Jehan De Gourmont, Paris, J.&nbsp;Besson,
Lyons, and J.&nbsp;Bouchet at Poitiers, early in the following century.
The angels nearly always occur in couples, as in the case of Antoine
Vérard, one of
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<a name = "page22" id = "page22"> </a>
the earliest printers to adopt this form; but a few exceptions may be
mentioned where only one appears, namely, in the Mark of Estienne
Baland, Lyons (1515), in which an angel is represented as confounding
Balaam’s ass; and in that of Vincent Portunaris, of the same place and
of about the same time, in which an angel figures holding an open book;
in the four employed by G.&nbsp;Silvius, an Antwerp printer (1562), in
three of which the figure is also holding a book; in the elaborate Mark
of Philip Du Pré, Paris, 1595, and in the exceeding rough Mark of Jannot
de Campis, of Lyons, 1505. Curiously enough, the subject of Christ on
the cross was very rarely employed, an exception occurring in the case
of Schäffeler, of Constance, or Bodensee, Bavaria, 1505. The same
centre-piece, without the cross, was employed by Jehan Frellon, Paris,
1508, and evidently copied by Jehan Burges, the younger, at Rouen, 1521,
whilst that of Guillaume Du Puy, Paris, 1504, has already been referred
to. The Virgin Mary occurs occasionally, the more notable examples being
the Marks of Guillaume Anabat, Paris, 1505&ndash;10, really a careful
piece of work; and the elder G.&nbsp;Ryverd, Paris, 1516, and in each
case with the infant Jesus. St. Christopher is a subject one sometimes
meets with in Printers’ Marks: in that of Gervais Chevallon, Paris,
1538, it however plays a comparatively subordinate part, and its merits
were only fully recognized by the Grosii, of Leipzig, who nearly always
used it for about two centuries, 1525&ndash;1732; the example bearing
the last date is by far one of the most
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
<a name = "page23" id = "page23"> </a>
absurd of its kind&mdash;the cowled monk with a modern lantern lighting
St. Christopher on his way through the river is a choice piece of
incongruity. Another phase of the religious element capable of
considerable expansion is that in relation to the part played in Marks
by saints and priests generally. Sometimes these are found together with
an effect not at all happy, notably the two Marks of Jehan Olivier,
Paris, 1518, which, with Jesus Christ on one side, a&nbsp;Pope on the
other, and an olive tree, are sufficiently crude to present an
appearance which seems to-day almost blasphemous. The last of the
several religious phases of Printers’ Marks to which we shall allude is
at the same time the most elaborate and complicated. We refer to that of
the Cross. The subject is sufficiently wide to occupy of itself a small
volume, but even after the most careful investigation, there are many
points which will for ever remain in the region of doubt and obscurity.
Tradition is proverbially difficult to eradicate; and all the glamour
which surrounds the history of the Cross, and which found expression in,
among other popular books, the “Legenda Aurea,” maintained all its
pristine force and attractiveness down to the end of the sixteenth
century. The invention of printing and the gradual enlightenment of
mankind did much in reducing these legends into their proper place; but
the process was gradual, and whatever may have been their private
opinions, the old printers found it discreet to fall into line with the
established order of things. Indeed, the religious sentiment was perhaps
never
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<a name = "page24" id = "page24"> </a>
so alive as at the time of the invention of printing, in proof of which
some of the earliest and most magnificent typographical monuments may be
cited,&mdash;the Gutenberg Bible, the Psalter of Fust and Schoeffer, for
example. The accompanying plate will give the reader a faint idea of the
extraordinary variety of crosses to be found on Printers’ Marks used
chiefly by the Italian printers.</p>

<p>M. Paul Delalain has touched upon this exceedingly abstract phase of
Printers’ Marks in the third <i>fascicule</i> of his “Inventaire des
Marques d’Imprimeurs,” without, as he himself admits, arriving at any
very definite conclusion. The cross, whether in its simplest form or
with a complication of additional ornaments, has, as he points out, been
at all times popular in connection with this subject. It appeared on the
shield of Arnold Ther Hoernen, Cologne, 1477, at Stockholm in 1483, at
Cracovia in 1510. That it did not fall entirely into desuetude until the
end of the eighteenth century is a very striking proof of what
M.&nbsp;Delalain calls “la persistance de la croix.” It has appeared in
all forms and in almost every conceivable shape. Its presence may be
taken as indicating a deference and a submission to, as well as a
respect for, the Christian religion, and M.&nbsp;Delalain is of the
opinion that the sign “<ins class = "correction" title = "error for ‘eut’?">eu</ins> pour origine l’affiliation à une confrérie religieuse.”
Finally, in his introduction to Roth-Scholtz’s “Thesaurus Symbolarum ac
Emblematum,” Spoerl asks, “Why are the initials of a printer or
bookseller so often placed in a circle or in a heart-shaped border, and
then surmounted by a cross?
<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
<a name = "page26" id = "page26"> </a>
Why at the extreme top of the cross is the lateral line formed into a
sort of triangular four? Why, without this inexplicable sign, has the
cross a number of cyphers, two, or even three, cross-bars? Why should
the tail of the cypher 4 itself be traversed by one or sometimes two
perpendicular bars which themselves would appear to form another cross
of another kind? Why, among the ornamental accessories, do certain
species of stars form several crosses, entangled or isolated? Why, at
the base of the cross is the V duplicated?” All these are problems which
it would be exceedingly difficult to solve with satisfaction. We do not
propose offering any kind of explanation for these singular marks; but
it will not be without interest to point out that among the more
interesting examples are those used by Berthold Rembolt, André Bocard or
Boucard, Georges Mittelhus, Jehan Alexandre, Jehan Lambert, Nicole De La
Barre, and the brothers De Marnef, all printers or booksellers of Paris;
of Guillaume Le Talleur, Richard Auzolt, of Rouen; of Jaques Huguetan,
Mathieu Husz, François Fradin, Jacques Sacon or Sachon, and Jehan Du
Pré, all of Lyons; of Jehan Grüninger, of Strassburg; of Lawrence
Andrewe, and Andrew Hester, of London; the unknown printer of St.
Albans; of Leeu, of Antwerp; of Jacob Abiegnus, of Leipzig; of Pedro
Miguel, Barcelona; of Juan de Rosembach of Barcelona and other places;
of the four “alemanes” of Seville, and hundreds of others that might be
mentioned.</p>

<p>It is curious to note that, in spite of its great mediæval
popularity, the subject of St. George and
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<a name = "page27" id = "page27"> </a>
the Dragon rarely enters into the subject of Printers’ Marks, and of the
few examples which call for reference, those of Thomas Périer and
Guillaume Bourgeat, of Paris and Tours respectively, are among the best
both in design and execution. The idea was also adopted by Guillaume
Auvray, of Paris; and by M. de Hamont, Brussels.</p>

<p>The personification of Time and Peace were both popular; and each has
its successful examples. One of the earliest instances of the former is
a pretty little mark, executed with a considerable amount of vigour, of
Robert De Gourmont, Paris; a&nbsp;large and vigorous Mark&mdash;one of
several&mdash;employed by Simon De Colines, Paris, in which it is
interesting to note that the scythe is not invariably denticulated; two
very crude but very distinct examples employed by Michel Hillenius or
Hooghstrate, Antwerp, 1514; and two, one large and the other small, of
Guillaume Chaudière, Paris, 1564; whilst Jean Temporal, of Lyons, 1550,
used it as an evident play on his name. The emblem of Peace does not
appear to have been much employed until well on into the sixteenth
century; N.&nbsp;Boucher, 1544, used as his motto, “pacem victis;”
Guillaume Julien, to whom reference has already been made; as likewise
Michel Clopejau, of a few years later, who used the words “Typus
amicitiæ” on his mark, with the further legend of “Quam sperata victoria
pax certa melior;” these three lived in Paris, whilst by far the best
decorative Mark in this connection was that adopted by Julien Angelier,
a&nbsp;bookseller and printer of Blois, 1555, the centre of whose
device,
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
<a name = "page28" id = "page28"> </a>
besides the words “Signum pacis,” includes a dove bearing two olive
branches. The fraternal device of two hands clasped may also be here
alluded to: it is of special interest from the fact that it was employed
by one of the earliest to
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<a name = "page29" id = "page29"> </a>
practice printing in Paris&mdash;Guy or Guyot Marchant, 1483, one of
whose Marks gives us a view of two shoemakers working with musical notes
representing So La (Sola), and “fides ficit” in gothic type. Thomas
Richard, sixty years afterwards, elaborated on a portion of this idea,
and his Mark shows two hands holding a crowned sceptre with two serpents
entwined around it. Designs much superior to these were employed by
Bertramus of Strassburg, at the latter part of the sixteenth century.
Following the example of Marchant, musical notes have occasionally been
employed by later printers. The rebus of this printer evidently
suggested that of Jehan and Anthoine Lagache, father and son, Arras, in
1517, the first syllable of whose name, La, is indicated by a musical
note, and is immediately followed by “gache.” Pierre Jacobi,
Saint-Nicholas-de-la-Port, and Toulouse, 1503, adopted Marchant’s idea
by giving “Sola fides ficit” with a musical start, so to speak; and a
distinctly novel phase of the subject is employed by Jacobus Jucundus,
Strassburg, 1531, in which a goose is represented as playing on a
violin.</p>

<p>Printers’ marks in which the pictorial embellishments partake of a
rustic nature, such as bits of landscape, seed-sowing, harvesting, and
horns of plenty, are numerous, and in many cases exceedingly pretty.
J.&nbsp;Roffet, Paris, 1549, employed the design of the seed-sower in
several of his Marks; and of about a dozen different Marks used at one
time or another by Jean De Tournes the first, Lyons, 1542, one of the
most successful
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<a name = "page30" id = "page30"> </a>
is a clever one having for its central figure a sower; the same idea, in
a very crude form, was contemporaneously employed also by De Laet,
Antwerp. The Cornucopia, or horn of plenty, was a very favourite emblem,
and it appears in a manifold variety of designs, sometimes with a
Caduceus (the symbol of Mercury) which is held by two clasped hands, as
in the case of T.&nbsp;Orwin, London, 1596, in a cartouche with the
motto: “By wisdom peace, by peace
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
<a name = "page31" id = "page31"> </a>
plenty;” four of the eight marks used by Chrestien Wéchel, Paris, 1522,
differ from Orwin’s in being surmounted by a winged Pegasus; and André
Wéchel, of the same city, 1535, employed one of the smaller devices of
Chrestien, with variations and enlargements of the same; in the Mark of
J.&nbsp;Chouet, Geneva, 1579, the caduceus
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
<a name = "page32" id = "page32"> </a>
is replaced by a serpent, the body of which is formed into a figure 8;
in that of Gislain Manilius, Ghent, the horns appear above two seated
figures. In each of the foregoing examples two horns appear. Georg
Ulricher von Andlau, Strassburg, 1529, used the cornucopia, and in one
of his Marks the figure is surrounded by an elaborate array of fruit and
vegetables; single horns appear also in the clever and elaborate marks
of R.&nbsp;Fouet, Paris, 1597, whose design was a very slight deviation
from that of J.&nbsp;De Bordeaux, Paris, 1567. The oak-tree, sheltering
a reaper and with the motto “Satis Quercus,” was employed by George
Cleray, Vannes, 1545; and the fruit of this tree&mdash;the
acorn&mdash;by E.&nbsp;Schultis, Lyons, 1491. The thistle appears on the
marks of Estienne Groulleau, Paris, 1547; the Rose on the more or less
elaborate designs of Gilles Corrozet, Paris, 1538; a&nbsp;rose-tree in
full flower occupies the centre of the beautiful mark of the first
Mathieu Guillemot, Paris, 1585; a&nbsp;solitary Rose-flower was the
simple and effective mark of Jean Dallier, Paris, 1545; and a flowering
branch of the same tree is one of the items on the charming little Mark
on the opposite page of Mathurin Breuille, Paris.</p>

<p>In the category of what may be termed extinct animals, the Unicorn as
a subject for illustrating Printers’ Marks enjoyed a long and extensive
popularity. The most remarkable thing in connection with these designs
of the Unicorn is perhaps their striking dissimilarity, and as nearly
every one of the many artists who employed, for no obvious reasons, this
animal in their Printer’s Marks had
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
<a name = "page33" id = "page33"> </a>
his own idea of what a Unicorn ought to have been like, the result,
viewed as a whole, is not by any means a happy one. Still, several of
the examples possess a considerable amount of vigour and have a distinct
decorative effectiveness. But apart from this its appearance in the
Marks of the old printers is a very striking proof of the fact that the
mediæval legends died hard. Curiously enough, the proverbial “lion and
unicorn” do not often occur together. The family of printers with whose
name the unicorn is almost as closely associated as the compass is with
Plantin, is that of Kerver, for it has been employed in over a dozen
different forms by one or other members from the end of the fifteenth
century to the latter
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
<a name = "page34" id = "page34"> </a>
part of the sixteenth. Sometimes there is only one Unicorn on the mark,
at others there is a pair. Le Petit Laurens, Paris, was using it
contemporaneously with the first Thielman Kerver, and possibly the one
copied the other. Sénant, Vivian, Kées, and Pierre Gadoul, Chapelet, and
Chavercher, were other Paris printers who used the same idea in their
marks before the middle of the sixteenth century. It was long a
favourite subject with the Rouen printers, one of the earliest in that
city to use it being J.&nbsp;Richard, whose design is particularly
original, inasmuch as the shield is supported on one side by a Unicorn,
and on the other by a female, possibly intended to represent a saint, an
idea which was apparently copied by Symon Vincent, Lyons; the Unicorn
was also used in the marks of L.&nbsp;Martin and G.&nbsp;Boulle, both of
Lyons; and also in the very rough but original design employed by
H.&nbsp;Hesker, Antwerp, 1496; whilst for its quaint originality a
special reference may be made to the Mark of François Huby, Paris, of
the latter part of the sixteenth century, for in this a Unicorn is
represented as chasing an old man. The origin of the Unicorn Mark is
essentially Dutch. The editions of the Printer, “à&nbsp;la licorne,”
<ins class = "correction" title = "spelling unchanged (may be quoting original)">Deft</ins>, 1488&ndash;94, are well known to students of
early printing. The earliest book in which this mark is found is the
“Dȳalogus der Creaturen” (“Dialogus Creaturarum”) issued at that city in
November, 1488. Henri Eckert de Hombergh and Chr. Snellaert, both of
Delf, used a Unicorn in their Marks during the latter years of the
fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Among other possible and impossible monsters and subjects of profane
history, the Griffin, the Mermaid, the Phœnix, Arion and Hermes has each
had its Mark or Marks. In the case of the first named, which, according
to Sir Thomas Browne,
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
<a name = "page36" id = "page36"> </a>
in his “Vulgar Errors,” is emblematical of watchfulness, courage,
perseverance, and rapidity of execution, it is not surprising that the
Gryphius family, from the evident pun on their surname, should have
considered it as in their particular preserves. As may be imagined, it
does not make a pretty device, although under the circumstances its
employment is perhaps permissible. Sebastien Gryphius, Lyons, and his
brother François, Paris, who were of German parentage, employed the
Griffin in about a dozen variations during the first half of the
sixteenth century. The Griffin, however, was utilized by Poncet Le
Preux, Paris, some years before the Gryphius family came into notoriety,
and it was employed contemporaneously with this by B.&nbsp;Aubri, Paris.
The Mermaid makes a prettier picture than the Griffin, but its
appearance on Printers’ Marks is an equally fantastic vagary of the
imagination. In one of the earliest Marks on which it occurs, that of
C.&nbsp;Fradin, Lyons, 1505, the shield is supported on one side by a
Mermaid, and on the other by a fully-armed knight; half a century after,
B.&nbsp;Macé, Caen, had a very clever little Mark in which the Mermaid
is not only in her proper element, but holding an anchor in one hand,
and combing her hair with the other. During the second quarter of the
sixteenth century, the idea was, with variations, used by G.&nbsp;Le
Bret, Paris, and J.&nbsp;De Junte, Lyons, as well as by John Rastell,
London, 1528, whose shop was at the sign of the Mermaid.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">From</span> what has already been stated,
it will be seen that the Printer’s Mark plays a by no means unimportant
part in the early history of illustration,&mdash;whether the phase be
serious or grotesque, sublime or ridiculous, we find here manifold
examples, crude as well as clever. Although it cannot be said with truth
that the Mark as an institution reached, like typography itself, its
highest degree of perfection at its inception, some of the earlier
examples, nevertheless, are also some of the most perfect. The evolution
from the small monogram, generally in white on a black ground, to an
elaborate picture occupying from a quarter to a whole page, was much
less gradual than is generally supposed. The unambitious marks of the
first printers were clearly adopted in consonance with the traders’ or
merchants’ marks which began to be so generally
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
<a name = "page41" id = "page41"> </a>
employed during the latter part of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>The very natural question, Which was the first Printer’s Mark? admits
of an easy answer. It was employed for the first time in the form of the
coupled shield of Fust and Schoeffer, in the colophon of the famous
Psalter printed by these two men at Mainz in 1457. This book is
remarkable as being the costliest ever sold (a&nbsp;perfect copy is
valued at 5,000 guineas by Mr. Quaritch): it is the third book printed,
and the first having a date, and probably only a dozen copies were
struck off for the use of the Benedictine Monastery of St. James at
Mainz. It is, however, quite as remarkable for the extraordinary beauty
of its initial letters, printed in red and blue ink, the letters being
of one colour and the ornamental portion of the other. The Mark of Fust
and Schoeffer, it may be mentioned, consists of two printer’s rules in
saltaire, on two shields, hanging from a stump, the two rules on the
right shield forming an angle of 45°: the adoption of a compositor’s
setting-rule was very appropriate. It was nearly twenty years before the
introduction of woodcuts into books became general, Gunther Zainer
beginning it at Augsburg in 1471&ndash;1475. The inception of this
movement was naturally followed by a general improvement, or at all
events elaboration, of the Printer’s Mark, which, moreover, now began to
be printed in colours, as is seen in the Fust and Schoeffer mark in red
which appears beneath the colophon of Turrecremata’s Commentary on the
Psalms printed by Schoeffer in 1474. Reverting
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
<a name = "page42" id = "page42"> </a>
for a moment to the Psalter which has been very properly described as
“the grandest book ever produced by Typography,” a&nbsp;very curious
fact not at all generally known may be here pointed out. Although the
few existing examples with two dates are of the same edition, there are
several very curious variations which are well worthy of notice. It will
be only necessary, however, in this place to refer to the fact that the
beautiful example in the Imperial Library at Vienna&mdash;which, from
its spotless purity, Heineken calls the “exemplaire
vierge”&mdash;differs from the others in being without the shield of
Fust and Schoeffer, a&nbsp;fact which points to the probability of this
copy having been the first struck off.</p>

<p>By the end of the fifteenth century the Printer’s Mark had assumed or
was rapidly assuming an importance of which its original introducers had
very little conception. Indeed, as early as 1539, a&nbsp;law, according
to Dupont, in his “Histoire de l’Imprimerie,” was passed by which these
marks or arms of printers and booksellers were protected. Unfortunately
the designs were very rarely signed, and it is now impossible to name
with any degree of certainty either the artist or engraver, both offices
probably in the majority of cases being performed by one man. There is
no doubt whatever that Hans Holbein designed some of the very graceful
borders and title-pages of Froben, at Basle, during the first quarter of
the sixteenth century, and in doing this he included the graceful
Caduceus which this famous printer employed. It does not necessarily
follow that he was the original
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
<a name = "page44" id = "page44"> </a>
designer, although he was in intimate association with Froben when the
latter first used this device. The distinctive Mark of Cratander, or
Cartander, which appears in the edition of Plutarch’s “Opuscula,” Basel,
1530, has also been confidently attributed to the same artist: if there
is any foundation for this statement Holbein was guilty of plagiarism,
for this Mark is a very slight modification on one used by the same
printer in 1519, and not only so dated but having the artist’s initials,
I.&nbsp;F. Those who have the opportunity of examining the “Noctes
Atticæ” of Aulus Gellius, printed by Cratander in 1519, will come upon
several highly interesting features in connection with this Mark, which
is emblematical of Fortune: the elaborately engraved title-page contains
an almost exact miniature of the same idea on either side, and it is
repeated in a larger form in the border which surrounds the first
chapter. The Mark occurs in its full size on the last page of all. The
title-page, borders and Mark are all by the same artist, I.&nbsp;F. In
the earlier example the woman’s hair completely hides her face, whilst
in that of eleven years later it is as seen on the opposite page, and
the whole design is more carefully finished. Dürer had dealt with the
same subject. In reference to Froben, however, it should be pointed out
that his Marks, of which there were several, show considerable variation
in their attendant accessories, and that Holbein could not possibly have
had anything to do with the majority of them.</p>

<p>To attempt to identify the designers of even a selection of the best
Printers’ Marks would be but
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
<a name = "page45" id = "page45"> </a>
to embark on a wild sea of conjecture. The initials of the engravers,
which occur much more frequently than those of the artists, are of very
little assistance to the identification of the latter. Many of them
possess a vigour and an originality which would at once stamp their
designers as men of more than ordinary ability. For picturesqueness, and
for the care and attention paid to the minutest details, it may be
doubted if either
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
<a name = "page46" id = "page46"> </a>
B.&nbsp;Picart in France, or J.&nbsp;Pine in this country, has ever been
excelled. The examples of the former come perhaps more in the category
of vignettes than of Printers’ Marks, although the charming little
pictures on the title-pages of Stosch’s “Pierres Antiques Gravées,”
1724, the “Impostures Innocentes,” 1734, and the edition of Cicero’s
“Epistolæ,” printed at the Hague by Isaac Vaillant, 1725,&mdash;to
mention only three of many&mdash;may be conveniently regarded as
Printers’ Marks. So far as we know, Pine only executed one
example,&mdash;representing a Lamb within a cleverly designed
cartouche&mdash;and this appears on the title-page of Dale’s Translation
of Freind’s “Emmenologia,” printed for T.&nbsp;Cox, “at the Lamb under
the Royal Exchange,” 1729: in its way it is unquestionably the most
perfect Mark that has ever been employed in this country. Any rule
differentiating the Printer’s Mark proper from a
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
<a name = "page47" id = "page47"> </a>
vignette is not likely to give general satisfaction; for a writer on the
subject of vignettes will unfailingly appropriate many that are Marks,
and <i>vice versa</i>. The present writer has found it a fairly safe
rule, to accept as a Mark a pictorial embellishment (on a title-page) to
which is appended a motto or quotation. The temptation to persuade
oneself that several of these vignettes are Printers’ Marks needs a good
deal of resisting, especially when such an exquisite example as that of
Daniel Bartholomæus and Son, of Ulm, is in question. The same holds good
with several of the dozen used by J.&nbsp;Reinhold Dulssecker,
Strassburg, about
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
<a name = "page48" id = "page48"> </a>
the latter part of the seventeenth and earlier part of the eighteenth
century; and very many others that might be named.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the Printer’s Mark preceded the
introduction of the title-page by nearly twenty years, and that the
first ornamental title known appeared in the “Calendar” of
Regiomontanus, printed at Venice by Pictor, Loeslein and Ratdolt in
1476, in folio. Neither the simple nor the ornate title-page secured an
immediate or general popularity, and not for many years was it regarded
as an essential feature of a printed volume. Its history is intimately
associated with that of the Printer’s Mark, and the progress of the one
synchronizes up to a certain point with that of the other. In beauty of
design and engraving, the Printer’s Mark, like the Title-page, attained
its highest point of artistic excellence in the early part of the
sixteenth century. This perhaps is not altogether surprising when it is
remembered that during the first twenty years of that period we have
title-pages from the hands of Dürer, Holbein, Wechtlin, Urse Graff,
Schauffelein and Cranach. In his excellent work entitled “Last Words on
the History of the Title-Page,” Mr. A.&nbsp;W. Pollard observes “From
1550 onwards we find beauty in nooks and corners. Here and there over
some special book an artist will have laboured, and not in vain; but
save for such stray miracles, as decade succeeds decade, good work
becomes rarer and rarer, and at last we learn to look only for
carelessness, ill-taste, and caricature, and of these are seldom
disappointed.” These remarks
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
<a name = "page49" id = "page49"> </a>
apply with equal force to the Printer’s Mark, although some
exceptionally beautiful examples appeared after that period.</p>

<p>The position allotted to the Printer’s Mark may not be of very great
importance, but it offers some points of interest. It appeared first in
the colophon, in which the printer usually seized the opportunity not
only of thanking God that he had finished his task, but of indulging in
a little puff either of his own part of the transaction or of the work
itself. The appearance of the Mark in the colophon therefore was a
natural corollary of the printer’s vanity. It soon outgrew its place of
confinement; and when a pictorial effect was attempted it became
promoted, as it were, to the title-page. In this position it was nearly
always of a primary character, so to speak, but sometimes, as in the
case of Reinhard Beck, it was almost lost in the maze of decorative
borders. But it is found in various parts of the printed book: in some
cases, among which are the Arabic works issued by Erpenius of Leyden, we
find the Mark at what we regard as the beginning of the book, but which
in reality is its end. Sometimes the Mark occupies the first and last
leaves of a book, as was often the case with the more important works
issued by Froben, by the brothers Huguetan and others. These two Marks
at the extreme portions of a book either differed from one another or
not, according to the fancy or convenience of the printer. The Mark also
appeared sometimes at the end of the index, or at the end of the
preliminary matter, such as list of contents or address of the author,
<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
<a name = "page51" id = "page51"> </a>
and its position was generally determined by several circumstances.</p>

<p>Now and then we have what may be described as a double Mark; that is,
of printer and bookseller, the one keeping a sharp look out to see that
the other did not have more than his fair share of credit. This is the
case with several books printed by Jehan Petit for Thielman Kerver,
Paris, of which an example is given in the previous chapter; Wynkyn de
Worde used Caxton’s initials for a time on his Mark, but the only motive
which could have prompted this was an affectionate regard for his
master. Some of the books which Jannot De Campis printed at Lyons for
Symon Vincent contained not only the printer’s, but two examples of the
bookseller’s Mark.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> consideration of the Printer’s
Mark as an institution in this country is characterized by extreme
simplicity, both as to its origin and to its design. From an entry in
one of the Bagford volumes (Harleian MSS. 5910) in the British Museum,
we learn that “rebuses or name devices were brought into England after
Edward III. had conquered France: they were used by those who had no
arms, and if their names ended in Ton, as Hatton, Boulton, Luton,
Grafton, Middleton, Seton, Norton, their signs or devices would be a Hat
and a tun, a&nbsp;Boult and a tun, a&nbsp;Lute and a tun, etc., which
had no reference to their names, for all names ending in Ton signifieth
town, from whence they took their names.” Even in England, therefore,
the merchant’s trade device was the direct source of the Printer’s Mark,
which it antedated by over a century. It will be convenient,
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
<a name = "page53" id = "page53"> </a>
first of all, to explain that the first printing-press in England was
that of William Caxton at Westminster, whose first book was issued from
this place November 18, 1477; the second was that of Theodoricus de
Rood, at Oxford, the first book dated December 17, 1478; the third was
that of the unknown printer at St. Albans, 1480, and the fourth was that
of John Lettou, in the city of London, 1480, the last-named being soon
joined by William de Machlinia, who afterwards carried on the business
alone. The earliest phases of wood-engraving employed at one or other of
these four distinct houses were either initial letters or borders around
the page. At Caxton’s press, as the late Henry Bradshaw has pointed out
in a paper read before the Cambridge Antiquarian Society, February 25,
1867, simple initials are found in the Indulgences of 1480 and 1481; at
the Oxford press an elaborate border of four pieces, representing birds
and flowers, is found in some copies of the two books printed there in
October, 1481, and July, 1482. Of illustrations in the text, we find a
series of diagrams and a series of eleven cuts illustrating the text of
the first edition of “The Mirror of the World,” 1481; a&nbsp;series of
sixteen cuts to the second edition of “The Game of Chesse Moralised,”
1483; and two works of the following year, “The Fables of Esop” and the
first edition of “The Golden Legend,” each contains not only a large cut
for the frontispiece, but in the case of the former, a&nbsp;series of
185 cuts, and, in the latter, two series of eighteen large and fifty-two
small cuts. At the Oxford press only two books
<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
<a name = "page54" id = "page54"> </a>
are known with woodcut illustrations, in neither case cut for the work;
at the St. Albans press the only known illustrations in the text are the
coats-of-arms found in the “Book of Hawking, Hunting and Coat-Armours,”
1486; at the press of Lettou and W. de Machlinia there is no trace of
illustrations.</p>

<p>These few introductory facts, condensed from Mr. Bradshaw’s paper
above mentioned, have a distinct interest to us as leading up to the
employment of the Printer’s Mark. It is certainly curious that at
Caxton’s press the very familiar device was only first used about
Christmas, 1489, in the second folio edition of the Sarum “Ordinale.” At
first this bold and effective mark was used, as in the “Ordinale,” the
“Dictes of the Philosophers,” and in the “History of Reynaud the Fox,”
at or close to the beginning of the volume. In Caxton’s subsequent books
it is always found at the end. At the St. Albans press the device with
“Sanctus Albanus” is found in two of the eight books printed there, “The
English Chronicle,” 1483, where it is printed in red, and in “The Book
of Hawking,” etc., 1486; it is formed of a globe and double cross, there
being in the centre a shield with a St. Andrew’s cross.</p>

<p>So far as regards Caxton’s device, it is easier to name the books in
which it appeared than to explain its exact meaning. The late William
Blades accepts the common interpretation of “W.&nbsp;C. 74.” Some
bibliographers argue that the date refers to the introduction of
printing in England, and quote the colophon of the first edition of the
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
<a name = "page56" id = "page56"> </a>
“Chess” book in support of this theory. But the date of this work refers
to the translation and not to the printing, which was executed at
Bruges, probably in 1476. Caxton did not settle at Westminster until
late in that year, and possibly not until 1477. In all probability the
date, supposing it to be such, and assuming that it is an abbreviation
of 1474, refers to some landmark in our printer’s career. Professor
J.&nbsp;P. A.&nbsp;Madden, in his “Lettres d’un Bibliophile,” expresses
it as his
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
<a name = "page57" id = "page57"> </a>
opinion that the two small letters outside the “W.&nbsp;74&nbsp;C” are
an abbreviation of the words “Sancta Colonia,” an indication that a
notable event in the life of Caxton occurred in 1474 at Cologne. Ames,
Herbert, and others have copied a device which Caxton never used: it is
much smaller than the genuine one (which, in other respects, it closely
resembles) which we reproduce from Berjeau. The opinion that the
interlacement is a trade mark is, Mr. Blades points out in his
exhaustive “Life,” much strengthened by the discovery of its original
use. In 1487, Caxton, wishing to print a Sarum Missal, and not having
the types proper for the purpose, sent to Paris, where the book was
printed for him by G.&nbsp;Maynyal, who in the colophon states
distinctly that he printed it at the expense of William Caxton of
London. When the printed sheets reached Westminster, Caxton, wishing to
make it quite plain that he was the publisher, engraved his design and
printed it on the last page, which happened to be blank. Mr. Blades
gives 1487 as the year in which this Missal (of which only one copy is
known) was printed, but Mr. Bradshaw puts it at 1489. The former
enumerates twelve books printed by Caxton in which his device
occurs&mdash;all ranging from the aforesaid Missal to the year 1491, the
date of his death.</p>

<p>Wynkyn de Worde, a native of Lorraine, who was with Caxton at Bruges
or Cologne, carried on the business of his master at Westminster until
1499, when he removed to the sign of the Golden Sun, Fleet Street,
London. He had nine Marks,
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
<a name = "page58" id = "page58"> </a>
the earliest of which is often described as one of Caxton’s, from the
genuine example of which, as we have already stated, it differs in being
smaller, with a different border, and in having a flourish inserted
above and below the letters. The second is an elongated variation of
No.&nbsp;1, with the name Wynkyn de Worde on a narrow white space
beneath the device. The next four devices are more or less elaborations
upon that of which we give a reproduction; the seventh is the
Sagittarius device in black with white characters: between the
sagittarii is seen the sun and flaming stars, and below the initials
“W&nbsp;C” in Roman letters, with the name Wynkyn de Worde at the foot;
the eighth is a picturesque Mark copied from one belonging to Froben,
with the omission of part of the background; it consists of a
semicircular arch, supported by short-wreathed pillars, with foliated
capitals, plinths and bases: on the top of each is a
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
<a name = "page59" id = "page59"> </a>
boy habited like a soldier, with a spear and shield bending forwards;
a&nbsp;large cartouche German shield is supported by three boys. The
ninth Mark of this printer was a large and handsome one, being a royal
and heraldic device which Wynkyn de Worde used as a frontispiece to the
Acts of Parliament, in the form of an upright parallelogram which
encloses a species of arched panel or doorway, formed of three lines,
imitating clustered columns and Gothic mouldings, and two large square
shields, that on the left charged with three fleurs-de-lys for France,
and the other bearing France and England quarterly, each of which is
surmounted by a crown. For a very minute description of these Marks, and
their variations, the reader is referred to Johnson’s “Typographia,” and
Bigmore and Wyman’s “Bibliography of
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>

<p>Among the 200 odd books which Richard Pynson printed between 1493 and
1527, we find six Marks (besides variants), of which five are very
similar, and of these we give two examples, the smaller being one of the
earliest, in which it will be noticed that the drawing is much inferior
to the larger example; the sixth Mark is a singular one, consisting of a
large upright parallelogram surrounded by a single stout line, within
which are the scroll, supporters, shield and cypher, crest, helmet and
mantling, and the Virgin and St. Catherine, and in many other
particulars differing from the other five examples. Robert Redman, who,
after quarrelling with
<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
<a name = "page61" id = "page61"> </a>
Richard Pynson, and apparently succeeding him in business, employed a
device almost identical with that which Pynson most frequently used, and
to which therefore we need not further refer. In chronological sequence
the next English printer who employed a device is Julian Notary, who was
printing books for about twenty years subsequent to 1498, first at
Westminster, then near Temple Bar, and finally in St. Paul’s Churchyard.
He had two devices (of which there are a very few variations), of which
we give the more important. The other has only one stout black line, and
not two, and it has also the Latinized form of the name&mdash;Julianus
Notarius. About two dozen different works of this printer are known to
bibliographers. In connection
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
<a name = "page62" id = "page62"> </a>
with Notary, we may here conveniently refer to an interesting, but
admittedly inconclusive article which appears in <i>The Library</i>, i.,
pp. 102&ndash;5, by Mr. E.&nbsp;Gordon Duff, in which that able
bibliographer publishes the discovery of two books which would point to
the existence of an unrecorded English printer of the fifteenth century.
One of these has the title of “Questiones Alberti de modis
significandi,” and the other, of which only a fragment is known to
exist, is a Sarum “Horæ,” which is dated 1497. In the colophons of
neither does the name of the printer transpire, but his Mark is given in
both&mdash;in the former book in black, and in the latter in red. This
mark is identical with Notary’s, with this important exception, that,
whereas in Notary’s device his name occurs in the lower half of the
device, in these the lower half is occupied by the initials I.&nbsp;H.,
and the upper half by the initials I N B, the I N being in the form of a
monogram, and not distinct. In 1498 this same block was used on the
title-page of the Sarum “Missal,” printed by Notary, who altered it to
suit his own requirements. We cannot follow Mr. Gordon Duff in his
conjectures as to the probability of who this unknown printer may have
been, but the matter is one of great bibliographical interest. William
Faques, who was the King’s Printer, and who is known to have issued
seven books between 1499 and 1508, had only one Mark, which is totally
different from those of any of his predecessors, as may be seen from the
example given on <a href = "#fig16">page 16</a>, where will also be
found references to the sources of the scriptural quotations on the
white and black triangles.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">63</span>

<p>The extreme rarity of this printer’s books will be best understood
when it is stated that there are only two examples in the British
Museum; one of these is a “Psalter,” 1504. With W.&nbsp;Faques we
exhaust the fifteenth century printers who employed marks to distinguish
the productions of their presses.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the similarity in their surnames it is not at all
certain that Richard Fawkes (1509&ndash;1530), who also appears as
Faukes, Fakes, and Faques, was related to the last-mentioned printer.
His books are now of excessive rarity. The unicorn (regardant on either
side of the device) appears for the first time in an English mark. Henry
Pepwell
<span class = "pagenum">64</span>

(1505&ndash;1539), of the Holy Trinity in St. Paul’s Churchyard, was a
bookseller rather than a printer, and all his earlier books were printed
in Paris; his Mark, in which occurs the heraldic device representing the
Trinity, was suggested by the sign of his shop. The most important
example of the thirty books which issued from the little-known press of
Peter Treveris, who was apparently putting forth books from 1514 to
1535, is “The Grete herball whiche geveth parfyt knowlege and
und[er]standing of all maner of herbes,” etc., 1526, a&nbsp;finely
printed folio (“at the signe of the Wodows”), of which a second edition
appeared in 1529. The earlier edition contains, on the recto of the
sixth
<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
<a name = "page65" id = "page65"> </a>
leaf, a&nbsp;full-page woodcut of the human skeleton, with anatomical
explanations, whilst the last leaf contains a full-page woodcut of the
printer’s Mark, with the imprint at the foot. Herbert supposes that the
sign of the “Wodows,” mentioned by Treveris in the colophon, might
possibly be put for wode hommes or wild men, and alludes to the
supporters used in the device. Treveris printed for several booksellers,
notably John Reyves, of St. Paul’s Churchyard, and for Lawrence Andrewe,
of Fleet Street. In this printer’s Mark, and in fact nearly every other
sixteenth century example, there is a very evident French influence,
whilst many of the examples are the most transparent imitations of Marks
used by foreign printers. Of the three used

two were mere copies of the Marks used by Denis Roce of Paris. We give
an illustration of one example; the second is of the same design, but
with a very rich stellated background, and the motto,
“A&nbsp;l’aventure, tout vient a point qui peut attendre.” His own
device was an exceedingly simple long strip, with the letters Iohn Skot
in antique Roman characters. An example of the last mark will be found
in “The Golden Letanye in Englysshe,” printed by Skot in “Fauster Land,
in Saynt Leonardes parysshe”; but examples of this press are excessively
rare, only one, “Thystory of Jacob and his XII Sones,” fourteen leaves,
in

verse, and printed about 1525, being in the British Museum, and another
tract, “The Rosary,” 1537, being in the Althorp Library now transferred
to Manchester.</p>

<p>Robert Copland, who was a beneficiaire and pupil of Wynkyn de Worde,
was a translator as well as a printer and stationer, and his shop was at
the sign of the Rose Garland in Fleet Street. Although he carried on
business from 1515 to about 1548, only a few of his books are now known,
none of which appear to be in the British Museum. The majority were
purely ephemeral. The most interesting phase of this printer’s career
occurs in connection with one or two books printed by Wynkyn de Worde,
notably “The Assembly of Foules,” 1530, at the end of which is “Lenvoy
of Robert Copland boke prynter,” one of the three verses running
thus:</p>

<div class = "verse">

<p>The three Marks of Copland make allusion to the roses which appeared
as a sign to his shop. The most elaborate design is an upright
parallelogram within which appears a flourishing tree springing out of
the earth, and supporting a shield suspended from its branches by a belt
and surrounded by a wreath of roses; on the left-hand side is a hind
regardant collared with a ducal
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
<a name = "page68" id = "page68"> </a>
coronet standing as a supporter, and on the right is a hart in a similar
position and with the same decorations; there are four scrolls
surrounding the centre-piece, on the top one is “Melius est,” on the
right-hand one “nomen bonum,” on the bottom one “q&nbsp;diuitie,” and on
the left-hand one “multe. Prou. xxii,” <i>i.e.</i> “A&nbsp;good name is
better than much riches.” The second device, of which we also give an
example, is self-explanatory, and is perhaps the more original. It has
also an additional interest from the fact that it was used by William
Copland, 1549&ndash;1561, who was probably a son of Robert, and who
simply altered the mark to the extent of substituting his own Christian
name for that of Robert in the scroll at the bottom of the device. Over
sixty books by this printer are described by bibliographers, and many of
them are in the British Museum. Robert Wyer, whose shop was at the
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
<a name = "page69" id = "page69"> </a>
sign of St. John the Evangelist, in St. Martin’s parish, in the rents of
the Bishop of Norwich, near Charing Cross, was another printer whose
works were more remarkable for their number than for their typographic
excellence. His earliest dated work is the “Expositiones Terminarum
Legum Anglorum,” 1527, and his latest “A&nbsp;Dyalogue Defensyue for
Women,” 1542, but as to nearly sixty others of his works no date is
attached, he may have commenced earlier than the first date and
continued after the second. The marks of Wyer consisted of two or three
representations of St. John the Divine writing, attended by an eagle
holding the inkhorn; he is seated on a rock in the middle
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
<a name = "page70" id = "page70"> </a>
of the sea intended to represent the Isle of Patmos. Laurens, or
Lawrence, Andrewe, by Ames stated to be a native of Calais, printed a
few books during the third decade of the sixteenth century, and resided
near the eastern end of Fleet Street at the sign of the Golden Cross.
His Mark consisted of a shield which is contained within a very rudely
cut parallelogram; the escutcheon is supported by a wreath beneath an
ornamental arch, and between two curved pillars designed in the early
Italian style, with a background formed of coarse horizontal lines.
Three of his books are in the British Museum. The Museum possesses only
one book with the imprint of Andrew Hester, who was a bookseller of the
“White Horse,” St. Paul’s
<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
<a name = "page71" id = "page71"> </a>
Church Yard, and this is an edition of Coverdale’s Bible, “newly
oversene and correcte,” which appears to have been printed for him by
Froschover, of Zurich, 1550. Among English Marks of the period, Hester’s
possesses the merit of being original.</p>

<p>One of the most prolific of the printers of the first half of the
sixteenth century was Thomas Berthelet, who succeeded Pynson in the
office of King’s Printer, at a salary of £4 yearly, and who (or his
immediate successors, for he died at the end of 1555) issued books from
1528 to 1568, of which nearly 150 are known to bibliographers, sixty
being in the British Museum. His shop was
<span class = "pagenum">72</span>
<a name = "page72" id = "page72"> </a>
at the sign of the “Lucretia Romana,” a&nbsp;charming
engraving&mdash;the most carefully executed of its kind used in this
country up to that time&mdash;of which, with his own name on a scroll,
he used as a Mark. Several of his books were printed in Paris. He issued
a large number of works in classical literature, and among the more
notable of his publications were Chaloner’s translation of Erasmus’s
“Praise of Folly,” 1549, Gower’s “De Confessione Amantis,” and the
“Institution of a Christen Man,” with a woodcut border to the title by
Holbein. John Byddell, otherwise Salisbury, 1533&ndash;44, was another
printer whose Mark was derived from the sign of the shop in which he
carried on business, namely, “Our Lady of Pity,” next Fleet Bridge, but
he afterwards removed to the Sun near the Conduit, which was probably
the old residence of Wynkyn de Worde, for whom he was an executor. The
Lady of Pity is personified as an angel with outstretched wings,
<span class = "pagenum">73</span>
<a name = "page73" id = "page73"> </a>
holding two elegant horns or torches, the left of which is pouring out a
kind of stream terminating in drops, and is marked on the side with the
word “Gratia”; that on the right contains fire and is lettered
“Charitas”: the lower ends of these horns are rested by the angel upon
two rude heater shields, on the left of which is inscribed “Johan
Byddell, Printer,” and on the other is a mark which includes the
printer’s initials; round the head of the figure are the words, “Virtus
beatos efficit.” This is merely a copy of one of the Marks used by
J.&nbsp;Sacon, a&nbsp;Lyonese printer, 1498&ndash;1522. Byddell’s books
were distinctly in keeping with the seriousness of his sign, and among
others we find such titles as “News out of Hell,” 1536, “Olde God and
the Newe,” 1534, “Common Places of Scripture,” 1538, etc., besides two
“Primers.” Thomas Vautrollier, who printed books at Edinburgh and London
from about 1566 to 1605, had four Marks, in all of which an anchor is
suspended from the clouds, and two leafy boughs twined, with the motto
“Anchora Spei,” and with a framework which is identical with that of
Guarinus, of Basle. Vautrollier was a native of France; nearly all his
books were in Latin. In 1584 he printed an edition of Giordano Bruno’s
“Spaccio de la Bestia Trionfante,” with a dedication to Sir Philip
Sidney, and for which he had to flee the country, for the imprint,
“Stampato in Parigi,” was an obvious and unsuccessful attempt to
hoodwink the authorities. In the following year he printed at Edinburgh
“A&nbsp;Declaration of the Kings Majesties intention and meaning toward
<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
<a name = "page74" id = "page74"> </a>
the lait Actis of Parliament.” J.&nbsp;Norton, 1593&ndash;1610, also
used the same Mark.</p>

<p>Richard Grafton, 1537&ndash;72, who was a scholar and an author, is
one of the best known of the sixteenth
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
<a name = "page75" id = "page75"> </a>
century printers, and, although he issued a large number of books,
confined himself to a single Mark, which was a rebus or pun upon his
name. Grafton was for several years in partnership with Edward
Whitchurche, and also with John Butler. The most important works
accomplished by the two first named were the first issue of the Great or
Cromwell’s Bible, 1539, and Coverdale’s version of the New Testament,
1538&ndash;9, in Latin and English; the latter being partly printed in
Paris by Regnault, and completed in London: as nearly the entire
impression was burnt by order of the Inquisition, it is of great rarity
and value. Grafton, who was printer to Edward VI. both before and after
his accession to the throne, issued a
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
<a name = "page76" id = "page76"> </a>
magnificent edition of Halle’s “Chronicle,” 1548, and an “Abridgement of
the Chronicles” by himself in 1562, which in ten years reached a fourth
edition. Grafton found printing a much more hazardous calling than the
grocery business to which he had been brought up, for he was constantly
in difficulties, which on one occasion nearly cost him his life. The
idea which found expression in Grafton’s Mark naturally suggested itself
to William Middleton, or Myddleton, 1525&ndash;47, who succeeded to the
business of Robert Redman, and issued books from the sign of the “George
next to St. Dunstan’s Church in Fleet Street.” He had two devices, of
which we give the larger and more important: in the smaller the shield
is supported
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
<a name = "page77" id = "page77"> </a>
on either side by an angel. About forty of William Middleton’s books
have been described, one of the most notable being John Heywood’s “Four
P’s, a&nbsp;very merry Enterlude of a Palmer, a&nbsp;Pardoner,
a&nbsp;Poticary, and a Pedler.” Reginald or Reynold Wolfe,
1542&ndash;73, was the King’s Printer and a learned antiquary. Wolfe was
probably of foreign extraction, for there were several early sixteenth
century printers of the same surname in France, Germany, and
Switzerland. His printing-office was in St. Paul’s Churchyard, at the
sign of the Brazen Serpent, which emblem he used as a device,
a&nbsp;subject which, as we have already seen, was frequently employed
for a similar purpose abroad. Wolfe’s other device, of which there are
two sizes, consisted of an elegant cartouche German shield, on which is
represented a fruit-tree and two boys, one of whom is drawing down the
fruit with a stick, whilst the other is taking it up off the ground.
Over sixty books have been catalogued as the work of Reginald Wolfe.
John Wolfe, originally a fishmonger, started printing about 1560, and
from that year until 1601 we have an almost continuous stream of his
books, on a very great variety of subjects. Like several others of the
early printers, he was in constant warfare with the authorities, whose
rules and restrictions of the press were a source of ever-recurring
annoyances. He appears to have had as much difficulty in managing his
“authors” as with the Stationers’ Company, for he is referred to more
than once in very uncomplimentary terms in the Martin Marprelate tracts
of the period. The Mark here
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
<a name = "page78" id = "page78"> </a>
reproduced from Berjeau represents a fleur-de-lys seedling supported by
two savages, with the motto “Ubique Floret.” John Day, 1546&ndash;84, is
undoubtedly one of the best known and most prolific of the sixteenth
century printers, nearly 300 books having him as their foster-father. He
appears to have started in business at the sign of the Resurrection,
a&nbsp;little above Holborn Conduit, but removed in or about 1549 to
Aldersgate Street; he had several shops in various parts of the town,
where his literary wares might be disposed
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
<a name = "page79" id = "page79"> </a>
of, and he is remarkable in being the first English printer who used
Saxon characters, whilst he brought those of the Greek and Italic to
perfection. It is not possible to give in this place even a brief
summary of Day’s career, and it must suffice us to mention that
Archbishop Parker was among his patrons, and that the more important
books which appeared from his press included Fox’s “Acts and Monuments,”
1563, and the “Psalmes in Metre with Music,” 1571 (for the printing of
which he received a patent dated June 2, 1568). His best known device,
of which we give an example, has a double meaning; first it is a pun on
his name, and secondly an allusion to the dawn of the Protestant
religion. He used another Mark, which is a large upright parallelogram,
within the lines of which is a very elegant Greek sarcophagus bearing a
skeleton lying on a mat. At the head of the corpse are two figures
standing and looking down at it, of which the outer one is in
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
<a name = "page80" id = "page80"> </a>
the dress of a rich citizen, having his left hand on his sword, and the
other, who is pointing to the body, is dressed like a doctor or a
schoolmaster: from his mouth issues a scroll rising upwards in eight
folds, on four of which are engraven in small Roman capitals, “Etsi Mors
in dies accelerat,” and the remainder of the sentence, “Post Fvnera
virtus vivet tamen,” appears in similar letters on another scroll, which
is elegantly twined round the branches of a holly placed behind the
sepulchre, to indicate by a tree that blooms at Christmas the evergreen
nature of virtue; the sarcophagus, figures, and tree stand by the side
of a river, with some distant vessels, on the left hand of which are
rocky shores, with cities, etc., and in the upper corner of the left is
the sun breaking out of the clouds; the initials I&nbsp;D appear on the
lower left hand. This Mark is exceedingly rare; it occurs on the last
leaf of J.&nbsp;Norton’s translation of the Latin “Catechism,” 1570, and
also at the end of Churton’s “Cosmographical Glass.” There are several
variations of the Mark which we reproduce on <a href =
"#fig79">p.&nbsp;79</a>. William Seres, who was for some time anterior
to 1550 in partnership with Day (and at other times with Anthony
Scoloker, Richard Kele, and William Hill), printed over 100 books, in
many of which his monogram serves the purpose of a Mark.</p>

<p>Like so many other of the early printers, Richard Jugge,
1548&ndash;77, whose shop was at the sign of the Bible at the north door
of St. Paul’s, was a University man, having studied at King’s College,
Cambridge. “He had a license from Government to print
<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
<a name = "page82" id = "page82"> </a>
the New Testament in English, dated January, 1550; and no printer ever
equalled him in the richness of the initial letters and general
disposition of the text which are displayed therein.” On the accession
of Elizabeth to the throne, he printed the proclamation, November 17,
1558. About seventy books are catalogued as coming from his press. His
elegant Mark consists of a massive architectural panel, adorned with
wreaths of fruit, and bearing in the centre an oval within which is a
pelican feeding her young, surrounded by the mottoes, “Love kepyth the
Lawe, obeyeth the Kynge, and is good to the commen welthe,” and “Pro
Rege Lege et Grege.” On the left of the oval stands a female figure
having a serpent twined round her right arm, with the word “Prudentia”
underneath, whilst the second female figure, with a balance and a sword,
is called “Justicia”; in the bottom centre in a small cartouche panel is
the name R.&nbsp;Jugge in the form of a monogram. This Mark was also
used by J.&nbsp;Windet and by Alexander Arbuthnot, of Edinburgh, of
which we give the example of the last named. Hugh Singleton,
1548&ndash;82, appears to have earned as much notoriety among his
contemporaries for his “rather loose” principles as for the books which
he printed. He was often in conflict with the authorities, and very
narrowly escaped severe punishment for printing one of Stubbs’
outbursts, for which the author and Page the publisher had their right
hands cut off with a butcher’s knife and a mallet in 1581; Singleton was
pardoned. His Mark, of which there are variations, is sufficiently
<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
<a name = "page83" id = "page83"> </a>
self-explanatory, although it may be mentioned that for a time he dwelt
at the Golden Tun in Creed Lane. Walter Lynne, 1547&ndash;50, who was a
scholar and an author, had a shop at “Sommer’s Key near Billingsgate”
and printed about twenty sermons and other religious tracts in octavo,
employed the device given as an initial to the present chapter. John
Wyghte, or Wight, resembled Singleton somewhat in his facility for
running his head against established customs, and was on one occasion
fined for keeping his shop open on St. Luke’s Day, and on another for
selling pirated books. His shop was at the sign of the Rose, St. Paul’s
Churchyard, and his books&mdash;beginning with an edition of the
Bible&mdash;range from the year 1551 to 1596. His device was a portrait
of himself, which varies considerably both in size and in other
respects. Perhaps the most curious and interesting work which he
published was
<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
<a name = "page84" id = "page84"> </a>
“A&nbsp;Booke of the arte and manner how to plant and graffe all sortes

<p>The employment of the Geneva arms as a Printer’s Mark is confined, in
this country, to Rowland Hall, who, at the death of Edward VI.,
accompanied several refugees to Geneva, where he printed the Psalms,
Bible, and other works of a more or less religious character; his books
range from 1559 to 1563, and about two dozen are known to
bibliographers, and half of this number are in the British Museum. His
Mark has a double interest; first, from his residence in Geneva, and
secondly from the fact that the sign of his shop, “The Half Eagle and
Key,” was a still further
<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
<a name = "page85" id = "page85"> </a>
acknowledgment of the protection which he enjoyed in Geneva. This was
not his only Mark, but it is the only one to which we need refer. The
name of Richard Tottell, 1553&ndash;97, is much better remembered in
connection with the epoch-making little book, “Songes and Sonettes,”
1557, the first miscellany of English verse, than either of the other
seventy or eighty publications which bear his imprint. His shop was in
Fleet Street at the sign of the Hand and Star, the same idea serving him
as a Mark: the hand and star in a circle, with a scroll on either side
having the words “cum privilegio,” the whole being placed under an arch
supported by columns ornamented in the Etruscan style. One of the most
curious of the large number of books which came from the press of Henry
Bynneman, 1567&ndash;87, is “The Mariners boke, containing godly and
necessary
<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
<a name = "page86" id = "page86"> </a>
orders and prayers, to be observed in every ship, both for mariners and
all other whatsoever they be that shall travaile on the sea, for their
voyage,” 1575; a&nbsp;still more curious production of his press has the
following title, “Of ghostes and spirites walkyng by night, and strange
noyes, crackes and sundry fore warnynges, which commonly happen before
the death of men, great slaughters, and alterations of kyngdomes,” 1572.
Bynneman had served with Reynold Wolfe, and when he started in business
on his own account met with much encouragement from Archbishop Parker,
who allowed him to have a shop or shed at the north-west door of St.
Paul’s. He appears to have had two Marks, one of which was derived from
the sign of his shop, “The Mermaid,” with the motto, “Omnia tempus
habent,” and the other (here reproduced) of a doe passant, and the
motto, “Cerva charissima et gratissimus hinnulus pro.” Thomas Woodcock,
1576&ndash;94, who dwelt at the sign of the Black Bear, in St. Paul’s
Churchyard,
<span class = "pagenum">87</span>
<a name = "page87" id = "page87"> </a>
was a bookseller rather than a printer; his Mark is an evident double
pun on his surname.</p>

<p>During the last years of the sixteenth century, and the first three
decades of the seventeenth, there were two Jaggards among the London
printers; by far the better known is Isaac, who, with Edward Blount,
issued the first folio edition of Shakespeare’s plays; he seems to have
had no Mark, but William, 1595&ndash;1624, used the rather striking
device (page 88), which is thus described:
Serpent biting his tail, coiled twice round the wrist of a hand issuing
from the clouds and holding a wand from which springs two laurel
<span class = "pagenum">88</span>
<a name = "page88" id = "page88"> </a>
branches, and which is surmounted by a portcullis (the Westminster
Arms); in the last coil of the serpent the word “Prudentia.” Equally
distinct is the mark of Felix Kingston, or Kyngston, who printed a very
large number of books from 1597 to 1640; in this <ins class =
"correction" title = "text has ‘devise’">device</ins> we have the sun
shining on the Parnassus, and a laurel tree between the two conical
hills, with a sunflower and a pansy on either side.</p>

<p>The Mark of William Norton, 1570&ndash;93, whose shop was at the
King’s Arms, St. Paul’s Churchyard, was in a double sense a pun on his
name, consisting as it did of a representation of a Sweet-William
growing through a tun inscribed with the
<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
<a name = "page89" id = "page89"> </a>
letters “<span class = "smallroman">NOR</span>”; and something of the
same kind may be said of that employed by Richard Harrison,
1552&ndash;62, whose Mark is described by Camden as “an Hare by a sheafe
of Rye in the Sun, for Harrison.” In this connection we may also here
refer to the Mark employed by Gerard (or Gerald) Dewes, 1562&ndash;87,
whose shop was at the sign of the Swan in St. Paul’s Churchyard; this is
described by Camden thus: “and if you require more [<i>i.e.</i> in
reference to the prevailing taste for picture-writing such as the
designs of Norton and Dewes] I&nbsp;refer you to the witty inventions of
some Londoners; but that for Garret
<span class = "pagenum">90</span>
<a name = "page90" id = "page90"> </a>
Dewes is most remarkable, two in a garret casting Dewes at dice.” In the
same category also may be included the Mark of Christopher and Robert
Barker, the Queen’s Printers, who used a design of a man barking timber,
with the couplet</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“A Barker if you will,</p>
<p>In name but not in skill.”</p>
</div>

<p>From these and many other instances which might be cited, it will be
seen that by the end of the sixteenth century the Printer’s Mark in
England had declined into a very childish and feeble play upon the names
of the printers, and the subject therefore need not be further
pursued.</p>

<p>The natural result, moreover, of this decline was, in the following
century, followed by what practically amounts to extinction; and the few
exceptions to which we shall refer, and which are to some extent
<span class = "pagenum">91</span>
<a name = "page91" id = "page91"> </a>
selected at random, prove the truth of that theory. Thomas Creede,
1588&ndash;1618, whose shop was at the sign of the Catherine Wheel, near
the Old Swan in Thames Street, was one of the prolific printers of the
period, and his most common Mark is a personification of Truth, with a
hand issuing from the clouds striking on her back with a rod, and
encircled with the motto, “Veritas <ins class = "correction" title =
"spelled ‘viressit’ in pictured Mark">virescit</ins> vulnere.” Among the
numerous books which he printed was Henry Butte’s “Digets Dry Dinner,”
1599, for William Wood, a&nbsp;bookseller whose shop was at the sign of
Time, St. Paul’s Churchyard, and whose Mark was an almost exact copy of
one employed by Conrad Bade, a&nbsp;sixteenth century printer of Paris
and Geneva (who had apparently adopted his from that of Knoblouch of
Strassburg, which we give on another page): it represents a winged
figure of Time helping a naked woman out of what appears to be a cave,
with the motto, “Tempore patet occulata veritas”; this Mark follows the
introductory matter in the above-named work. Making a leap of over half
a century,
<span class = "pagenum">92</span>
<a name = "page92" id = "page92"> </a>
we come across another ambitious Mark, which in the present instance
served the additional purpose of a frontispiece; it was employed by John
Allen of the Rising Sun, St. Paul’s Churchyard, and is dated 1656; it is
rather a fine device of the sun rising behind the hills, with a
cathedral on the left-hand side, and the inscription “Ipswiche” and a
coat-of-arms, apparently of that city. Although not exactly a printer’s
or publisher’s Mark, the charming little plate, engraved by Clark, which
John Walthoe, Jr., inserted on the title-page of “The Hive:
a&nbsp;collection of the most celebrated Songs,” 1724, is sufficiently
near it to be worth reproducing here. T.&nbsp;Cox, a&nbsp;bookseller of
“The Lamb,” under the Royal Exchange, Cornhill, was fortunate enough to
have a Mark (see <a href = "#fig46">page 46</a>), in which John Pine is
seen at his best: Cox was not only an eminent bookseller, but was also
an exchange-broker. Of
<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
<a name = "page93" id = "page93"> </a>
much less delicate workmanship, but appropriate nevertheless, is the
Mark which we find on the title-pages of the books printed for
R.&nbsp;Ware, at the Bible and Sun in Warwick Lane, one of whose books,
Dr. Warren’s “Impartial Churchman,” 1728, contains at the end of the
first chapter
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
<a name = "page94" id = "page94"> </a>
another Mark, an exceedingly rough sketch of a printing-office, with the
motto, “vitam mortuis reddo.” On books intended more or less for
particular schools, the Printer’s Mark usually takes the shape of the
arms of the schools themselves, as in the case of Westminster and Eton;
and the same may be said of books printed at Oxford and Cambridge, in
the former case a very fine view of the Sheldonian Theatre usually
appearing on the title-page of books printed there. John Scolar is an
interesting figure among the very early printers of Oxford, and from
1518 he was the official printer of the University; in one of the books
he issued there is cited an edict of the Chancellor, under his official
seal, enjoining that for a period of seven years to come, no person
should venture to print that work, or even to sell copies of it
elsewhere printed within Oxford and its precincts, under pain of
forfeiting the copies, and paying a fine of five pounds sterling, and
other penalties. Scolar’s Mark is one of the very few in which a book
appears. John Siberch, the first Cambridge printer, apparently had two
Marks, one of which&mdash;the Royal Arms, which was the sign of the
house he occupied&mdash;appears on four of the eight books printed by
him at Cambridge in or about 1521; of the second we give a facsimile
from his first book, Galen, “De Temperamentis.” The Mark of the majority
of eighteenth century booksellers and printers consisted of a monogram
formed either with their initials or names. During a portion of his
career Jacob Tonson used a bust of what purported to
<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
<a name = "page95" id = "page95"> </a>
be Shakespeare, partly from the fact that for many years the copyright
of the great dramatist’s works belonged to him and partly because one of
his shops had for its sign, “The Shakespeare’s Head.”</p>

<p>The earliest Printers’ Marks of Scottish printers are not of the
first importance, but they are sufficiently interesting to merit notice.
Walter Chepman and Andro Myllar were granted a patent for the erection
of a printing-press at Edinburgh on September 15, 1507, the former
finding the money and the latter the knowledge. Each had his distinctive
Mark, both of which are of French origin&mdash;a&nbsp;theory which is
easily proved so far as Myllar’s is concerned from the fact that it
displays two small shields at the top corners, each charged
<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
<a name = "page96" id = "page96"> </a>
with the <i>fleur-de-lys</i>. Myllar’s device, in which we see a
windmill with a miller ascending the outside ladder, carrying a sack of
grain on his back, is an obvious pun on his name, and was, perhaps,
<span class = "pagenum">97</span>
<a name = "page97" id = "page97"> </a>
suggested by the Mark of Jehan Moulin, Paris. Chepman’s is a very close
copy of that of Pigouchet, Paris, the male and female figures being
carefully copied even to the small crosses on their knees; the initials
W C are elegantly interlaced. Thomas
<span class = "pagenum">98</span>
<a name = "page98" id = "page98"> </a>
Davidson is a very interesting figure in the early history of Scottish
typography; he appears to have been the first king’s printer of his
country, and one of his earliest works is “Ad Serenissimum Scotorum
Regem Jacobum Quintum de suscepto Regni
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
<a name = "page99" id = "page99"> </a>
Regimine a diis feliciter ominato Strena,” <i>circa</i> 1525; about ten
years later came a translation of the “Chronicles of Scotland,” compiled
by Boece, and “translatit be maister Johne Bellenden;” Davidson’s Mark
is of the same character as Chepman’s, but is, if possible, even more
roughly drawn and engraved; whilst Bassandyne copied the device of
Crespin of Geneva, with the initials T.&nbsp;B. instead I.&nbsp;C.
Arbuthnot’s device of the Pelican, which he used in two sizes, and the
Marks of Thomas Vautrollier, have been already referred to. Coming down
to the last twenty years of the sixteenth century, we find the few books
of Henry Charteris of considerable and varied interest, and his Mark, if
by no means carefully drawn and engraved, has at all events the merit of
being fairly original.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">It</span> is rather a curious fact, all
things considered, that the introduction of the printing-press into
Paris should have only antedated its appearance in this country by four
years; such however is the case. It was at the commencement of the year
1470, the tenth of the reign of Louis XI., that Ulrich Gering, Martin
Krantz, and Michel Friburger commenced printing in one of the rooms of
the College Sorbonne. They had learnt their art at Mayence, and at the
dispersal of the office of Fust and Schoeffer had settled down at Basel.
They were induced to take up their residence at the Sorbonne by Jean
Heinlin and Guillaume Fichet, two distinguished professors of that
place. The
<span class = "pagenum">101</span>
<a name = "page101" id = "page101"> </a>
first book printed at Paris was the “Letters” of Gasparin of Bergamo,
1470, which contains the following quatrain at the end of the work:</p>

<p>By the end of 1472 the three companions had issued thirty works,
apparently without indulging in the luxury of a Mark, but their patrons
separating they had to leave the Sorbonne. Their new quarters were at
the sign of the “Soleil d’Or” in the Rue St. Jacques&mdash;the
Paternoster Row of Paris. Here they remained until 1477, when Gering was
the sole proprietor. He was joined in 1480 by George Mainyal, and in
1494 by Bertholt Rembolt, and died in August, 1510. Within thirty years
of the introduction of printing into Paris, there were nearly ninety
printers, who issued nearly 800 works between 1470 and 1500. Rembolt,
who succeeded Gering and preserved the sign of his office, was one of
the earliest, if not the first to adopt a Mark, of which indeed he used
four more or less distinct examples. We reproduce one of the rarest; his
best known is a highly decorative picture, and has a shield (carrying a
cross with the initials B.&nbsp;R. in the lower half of the circle which
envelopes the foot of the cross) suspended from a vine tree and
supported by two lions. Of this Mark there are at least two sizes;
another of his Marks consisted of an enlarged form of the cross to which
we have referred.</p>

<p>After Rembolt, the interest of the Printer’s Mark in France diverges
into a number of directions. The most prolific printer was, perhaps,
Antoine Vérard, who, dying in 1530, issued books continuously for about
forty-five years: he was also a calligrapher, an illuminator, and a
bookseller; his Books of Hours led the way for the beautiful productions
of Simon Vostre, whilst his chief “line” consisted of romances, of which
there are over a hundred printed on vellum and ornamented with beautiful
miniatures. He had two Marks, one of which, consisting simply of the two
letters A.&nbsp;V., is accompanied by the lines:</p>

<p>Of the second we give an example on <a href =
"#fig21">p.&nbsp;21</a>. Among his publications may be mentioned “L’Art
de bien Mourir,” 1492, which Gilles Couteau and J.&nbsp;Menard printed
for him, whilst the punning Mark of the former is reproduced in our
first chapter (<a href = "#fig4">p.&nbsp;4</a>). François Regnault, who
printed a large number of books during the first half of the
<span class = "pagenum">105</span>
<a name = "page105" id = "page105"> </a>
sixteenth century, had six Marks, chiefly variations on the one here
given. He usually placed at the bottom of his books: “Parissis, ex
officinâ honesti viri Francissi Regnault”; the accompanying reduced
facsimile of one of his title-pages indicates the prominent position
allotted at this early period to the printer’s Mark. A&nbsp;very
remarkable and elaborate Mark of this family of printers was that of
Pierre Regnault, who was putting forth books during nearly the whole of
the
<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
<a name = "page106" id = "page106"> </a>
first half of the sixteenth century. The Marchant family existed in
Paris as printers for over 300 years (1481&ndash;1789). The first of the
line, Guy, or Guyot, who printed books for Jehan Petit, Geoffrey De
Marnef, and others, had as Mark four variations of the <i>chant
gaillard</i> represented by two notes, sol, la, with one faith
represented by two hands joined, in allusion to the words, “Sola fides
sufficit,” taken from the hymn, “Pange lingua.” Beneath his Mark he
placed the figures of Saints Crispin and Crispinian, patrons of the
leather-dressers who prepared the leather for the binder, in which
capacity Marchant acted on several occasions for Francis I.&nbsp;As was
the case with his contemporaries, Marchant’s earliest books possessed no
mark, and one of the first of the publications in which it appeared was
the “Compost et Calendrier des Bergiers,” 1496. The De Marnef family
also make a big show in the annals of French typography, particularly in
the way of Marks, the various members using, between 1481 and 1554,
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
<a name = "page107" id = "page107"> </a>
nearly thirty examples, including duplicates, several of which were
designed by Geoffrey Tory. Nearly all these Marks had the subject of the
Pelican feeding her young as a centre piece. Jerome, however, used a
Griffin among his several other examples, of which the two finest of the
whole series are those numbered 746 and 812 in Silvestre, and are the
work of Jean Cousin at his best. The founder of the family, Geoffrey,
used the accompanying device in two sizes. The Janot family, of which
the founder, Denys, was the most celebrated, were issuing books in Paris
from the end of the fifteenth to the middle of the eighteenth
<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
<a name = "page108" id = "page108"> </a>
century, and the more noticeable of their Marks contained the device:
“Amor Dei omnia vincit&mdash;amour partout, tout par amour, partout
amour, en tout bien” (see <a href = "#fig15">p.&nbsp;15</a>). The Macé
family, which makes a good show with eleven Marks, was also a long-lived
one of over 200 years, many of the members residing at Caen, Rennes, and
Rouen, besides Paris. The same may be said to some extent of the Dupré
or Du Pré family, 1486&ndash;1775; the two first, Jean or Jehan and
Galliot, were the most celebrated<ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">. </ins>Of the dozen Marks employed by this family, the most
original, it being the evident pun on his name, has a <i>Galiote</i>, at
the head of the
<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
<a name = "page109" id = "page109"> </a>
mast of which is the motto, “Vogue la Guallee,” or sometimes “Vogue la
Gualee” (see <a href = "#fig5">p.&nbsp;5</a>). Jehan Du Pré the Lyons
printer, used the accompanying Mark formed of his initials. The first as
well as the most noted member of the Le Rouge family of printers was
Pierre, who resided at Chablis, Troyes, and Paris, and who was the first
to take the title of “Libraire-Imprimeur du Roi,” ceded to him by
Charles VIII., and used in “La Mer des Histoires,” 1488. Appropriately
enough, Michel Le Noir, whose motto we have already quoted, may be here
referred to. He issued a large number of books, the most notable,
perhaps, being “Le
<span class = "pagenum">110</span>
<a name = "page110" id = "page110"> </a>
Roman de la Rose,” 1513. He was succeeded by his son Philippe in 1514,
one of whose most noticeable publications was “Le Blazon des Hérétiques”
(a&nbsp;satirical piece attributed to Pierre Gringoire), the figure or
effigy at the head is signed with the monogram of G.&nbsp;Tory. The five
Marks of father and son differed only in minor details, and the above
example of Philippe will sufficiently indicate the character of the
others. Philippe Pigouchet, who was an engraver as well as a bookseller
and printer, contented himself apparently with one Mark. He is
distinguished for the extreme care
<span class = "pagenum">111</span>
<a name = "page111" id = "page111"> </a>
with which he turned out his books, particularly the Books of Hours
which he undertook to produce in partnership with Simon Vostre; some of
his works are freely copied by the publishers of to-day, and might with
advantage be even more generally utilized than they are, for they
possess all the attributes of beautiful books. Thielman Kerver,
a&nbsp;German, was another printer who worked for Simon Vostre, one of
his most important productions being a “Breviarium ad usum Ecclesiæ
Parisiensis,” 1500, in red and black. His shop was on the Pont St.
Michel, at the sign of the Unicorn, which, as will be seen, he adopted
as his Mark,
<span class = "pagenum">112</span>
<a name = "page112" id = "page112"> </a>
and of which there are two, which differ from one another only in minor
details. Of Simon Vostre himself, a&nbsp;whole book might be compiled.
From about 1488 to 1528 he devoted himself exclusively to the publishing
of books, and employed all the best printers: it was by his energy
combined with Pigouchet’s technical skill that the two produced, in
April, 1488, the “Heures à l’Usaige de Rome,” an octavo finely decorated
with ornaments and figures; the experiment was a complete success. It is
generally assumed that the engraving was done in relief on metal, as the
line in it is very fine, the background stippled, and the borders
without scratches: wood could not have resisted the force of the
impression, the reliefs would have been crushed, the borders rubbed and
badly adjusted. The artistic connection of Pigouchet and Vostre lasted
for eighteen years, and with them book production in France may be said
to have attained its highest point. By the year 1520 Vostre had
published more than 300 editions of the “Hours” for the use of different
cities; he had two Marks, of which we give the larger example on <a href

<p>In many respects Jean or Jehan Petit is one of the most remarkable of
the early French printers, whilst from the time he started to the final
extinction of his descendants as printers covers a space of 336
years&mdash;a&nbsp;record which is probably unrivalled in the history of
typography. Jehan Petit kept fifteen presses fully employed, and found a
great deal of work for fifteen others. The family as a whole makes a
good show with
<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
<a name = "page114" id = "page114"> </a>
their marks, in which the founder is more extravagant than any of the
others, having used, at one time or another, at least half-a-dozen more
or less different examples. In addition to reproducing
<span class = "pagenum">115</span>
<a name = "page115" id = "page115"> </a>
one of the finest, we give, on <a href = "#fig9">p.&nbsp;9</a>, also a
reduced facsimile of a title-page of a book, the joint venture of Petit
and Kerver; the combination of the two names on one title-page is
distinctly novel and curious. He was on several occasions associated
with others in producing a book, his connection with Josse Bade
extending from 1501 to 1536. Of Bade or Badius it will be necessary to
give a few particulars. He was born at Asche, near Brussels, and was a
scholar and a poet as well as a printer. About 1495&ndash;7 he was
engaged as a corrector of the press for Treschel and De Vingle at Lyons.
He left about 1500 for Paris, where he started a press in 1502, which he
called “Prelum
<span class = "pagenum">116</span>
<a name = "page116" id = "page116"> </a>
Ascensianum.” In reference to this term, “the Ascension Press,” the word
“prelum” was applied to the ancient wine presses, after which, in fact,
the earliest printing presses were modelled. His Mark, which he first
used in 1507, is the earliest picture of a printing-press. Thirteen
years after, he adopted another device with the same subject, but
differing in many important particulars. In the second, the
composing-stick used by the figure in the act of setting type is changed
from the right
<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
<a name = "page117" id = "page117"> </a>
to the left hand; the press shows improved mechanical construction,
indicating greater solidity and strength. In the latter example also the
figure sitting at the case on the right side of the engraving is
intended to represent a woman, instead of a man as in the earlier
illustration. Contemporary with both Petit and Bade, Gilles or Gillet
Hardouyn, 1491&ndash;1521, was both a printer and a bookseller, and used
two Marks, of which we give the more striking. Germain Hardouyn,
possibly a son of the preceding, confined himself more particularly to
selling books during the first forty years of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Geoffrey Tory resembled many others of the early printers in being
also a scholar; but he was
<span class = "pagenum">118</span>
<a name = "page118" id = "page118"> </a>
also an artist and an engraver, taking up and carrying on the great work
inaugurated by Vostre and Vérard. He was born at Bourges in 1480, and
one of his earliest works, which was published by Petit and printed by
Gilles De Gourmont, was an edition of the “Geography” of Pomponius Mela,
1507, and between this time and his death he produced a number of Books
of Hours, the decoration of which can only be described as marvellous.
One of the most beautiful is undoubtedly the “Heures de la Vierge,”
executed for Simon De Colines. What interests us most, however, is the
Mark which he adopted when he entered into business as a printer and
bookseller; it is perhaps the most elegant that had been up to that time
designed. This Mark of the broken pitcher, with the motto “Non plus,”
first appeared at the end of a Latin poem issued in 1524, is regarded as
a <i>memento</i> of the death of his little daughter in 1522, and is
thus explained: the broken pitcher symbolizes her career cut short; the
book with clasps her literary studies; the little winged figure her
soul; and the motto “Non plus,” “Je ne tiens plus à rien.” He gives his
own interpretation of this Mark, however, in that curious medley of
poetry and philosophy which he called “Champfleury,” 1529. It may be
mentioned that on some of the bindings of his quarto volumes the broken
pitcher is transversed by the wimble or <i>toret</i>&mdash;an obvious
pun on his name.</p>

<p>The Estienne or Etienne family is probably the most important and
interesting of the sixteenth century printers of Paris. Silvestre
reproduces
<span class = "pagenum">119</span>
<a name = "page119" id = "page119"> </a>
twenty Marks which one or other of the Estiennes employed, and a
description of these might very well form a distinct chapter. But a
condensed review of the family as a whole must suffice. Henry, the first
of the name and chief of the family, was born at Paris about 1470; he
started in 1502 a printing and bookselling business in the Rue du
Clos-Bruneau, near the <i>Ecoles de Droit</i>; he adopted the device,
“Plus olei quam vini”; and twenty-eight works are catalogued as having
been printed by him. He died in 1521, leaving a widow and three
children&mdash;François, Robert, and
<span class = "pagenum">120</span>
<a name = "page120" id = "page120"> </a>
Charles. François I. continued the profession in company with Simon De
Colines, who had been associated with his father, and who married the
widow of Henry: his Mark is given as an initial to this chapter. Robert
I., the second son of Henry, was born in 1503, and is probably more
generally known as a Greek, Latin, and Hebrew scholar than as a printer.
For several years he, like his brother, was associated with De Colines;
he married Pétronille, daughter of Badius “Ascensius,” and was a
Protestant; in 1526 he established a printing-press in the Rue St.
Jean-de-Beauvois at the sign of the Olive. His editions of the Greek and
Latin classics were enriched with useful notes,
<span class = "pagenum">121</span>
<a name = "page121" id = "page121"> </a>
and promises of reward were offered to those who pointed out mistakes.
He used the types of his father and De Colines until about 1532, when he
obtained a more elegant fount with which he printed his beautiful Latin
Bible. In 1552 he retired to Geneva, when he printed, with his
brother-in-law, the New Testament in French. He established here another
printing-press, and issued a number of good books, which usually carried
the motto: “Oliva Roberti Stephani.” His Marks are at least ten in
number, of which seven are variations of the Olive device, and three
<span class = "pagenum">122</span>
<a name = "page122" id = "page122"> </a>
(in as many sizes) of the serpent on a rod intertwined with a branch of
a climbing plant. With the exception of François the other members of
the family used the Olive mark, sometimes however altering the motto,
and adding in some instances an overhead decoration of a hand issuing
from the clouds and holding a sickle or reaping hook. He died in 1559.
The third son of the founder, Charles, after receiving his diplomas as a
doctor of medicine, travelled in Germany and Italy, returning to Paris
in 1553, and started in business as a printer. Among the ninety-two
works which he printed, special mention may be made of the “Dictionarium
historicum ac poeticum, omnia gentium, hominum, locorum,” etc., Paris,
1553, reprinted at Geneva in 1556, at Oxford in 1671, and London, 1686.
He possessed the opposite attributes of being the best printer and of
having the worst temper of the family, and he alienated himself from all
his friends and relations; he was confined in the Chatelet in Paris, and
died there after two years in 1564. Henry II., son of Robert I., was
born in Paris in 1528; after leaving college he travelled on the
continent and visited England. He returned to Paris in 1552, when his
father was leaving for Geneva. In 1554 he started a printing-press; in
1566 he published a translation of Herodotus by Valla, revised and
corrected, defending, in the preface, the Father of History against the
reproach of credulity. Charles, brother of Robert I., established a
printing-press in 1551, and died crippled with debts in 1564. Robert
II., second son of Robert I., was born in 1530, and,
<span class = "pagenum">123</span>
<a name = "page123" id = "page123"> </a>
refusing to adopt the new religion, was disinherited by his father; he
started a printing-press on his own account when his father retired to
Geneva, and issued forty-eight books, some of which possessed the mark
of the Olive; he was the royal printer in 1561, and died in 1575.
François II., third son of Robert I., printed in Geneva from about 1562
to 1582. Robert III., elder son of Robert II., died in 1629. Paul, son
of Henry II., was born in 1566, and, after a brilliant scholastic
career, travelled on the continent, and started a printing-press at
Geneva in 1599, where he issued twenty-six editions of the classics
which were particularly notable for their correctness and notes. He died
in 1627, and his son Antoine, born 1594, established himself at
twenty-six years of age as a printer in Paris, reverted to Roman
Catholicism, was appointed printer to the king and to the clergy, dying
at the Hotel Dieu in 1674. The number of editions which this celebrated
family, starting in 1502 and finishing in 1673, issued, reaches the very
large number of 1590, thus classified: theology, 239; jurisprudence, 79;
science and arts, 152; belles lettres, 823; and history, 297. Of the
eleven members of this family, one died in exile, five in misery, one in
a debtor’s prison, and two in the hospital&mdash;“Lecteur, que vous
faut-il de plus?”</p>

<p>Although in France, as elsewhere, we have to look to the printers of
the fifteenth century for originality and decorative beauty, some
exceedingly interesting Marks occur in the sixteenth, and are well worth
studying. We have only space for
<span class = "pagenum">124</span>
<a name = "page124" id = "page124"> </a>
the enumeration of a few of the more important. Of these, Pierre Vidoue
comes well in the first rank. He was one of the most distinguished of
the early Parisian Greek typographers, besides being a person of
learning and eminence, and was issuing books up to the year 1544; his
edition of Aristophanes, 1582, published by Gilles De Gourmont, is
described as “a&nbsp;singularly curious impression,” whilst ten years
later he printed Guillaume Postel’s “Linguarum XII. characteribus
differentium Alphabetum,” which is described by La Caille as
<span class = "pagenum">125</span>
<a name = "page125" id = "page125"> </a>
the “first book printed in oriental character,” a&nbsp;statement,
however, which is incorrect so far as relates to the Hebrew. He had at
least three Marks, all more or less similar, in one of which, however,
the motto “<ins class = "correction" title = "written ‘audentes’ in pictured Mark">ardentes</ins> juvo,” is supplemented by “par sit fortuna
labori.” Of the six Roffets who were printing or publishing books in
Paris during the sixteenth century, the most notable is perhaps Pierre,
whose name frequently occurs in the bookbinding accounts of Francis I.;
of their seven Marks, nearly all more or less of the same “rustic”
character, the most decorative is that of Jacques (see <a href =
"#fig30">p.&nbsp;30</a>). In their separate ways, the Marks of Mathurin
Breuille, 1562&ndash;83 (<a href = "#fig33">p.&nbsp;33</a>), and Louis
Cyaneus, 1529&ndash;46, each possesses a pleasing originality, the
latter of which is inscribed with the motto “Tecum Habita.” The two
Wéchels, André and Chrestien, were among the most eminent of the
sixteenth century Parisian
<span class = "pagenum">126</span>
<a name = "page126" id = "page126"> </a>
printers, and between them employed over a dozen marks. All those of
André were variations of one type, namely, two hands holding a caduceus
between two horns of plenty surmounted by Pegasus. This had also been
used by Chrestien, of whose other Mark a reproduction is here given, and
of which there were several variations. Regnault Chaudière’s shop was in
the Rue St. Jacques, at the sign of “L’homme Sauvage,” which he adopted
for his Mark: this he appears to have changed for one emblematical of
Time when he took his son into partnership, and which, Maittaire thinks,
he may have borrowed of Simon De Colines, whose daughter (and only
child) he married. We give the largest of the examples used by Guillaume
Chaudière, 1564&ndash;98 on <a href = "#fig28">p.&nbsp;28</a>. Sébastien
Nivelle, who was working during the latter half of the sixteenth century
until the third year of the seventeenth century, is a very interesting
<span class = "pagenum">127</span>
<a name = "page127" id = "page127"> </a>
figure in the typographical annals of Paris. He was, at the time of his
death at the age of eighty years, the <i>doyen</i> of the trade. His
books were, for the most part, beautifully printed. His shop was in the
Rue St. Jacques at the sign of the Two Storks, which he adopted for his
exceedingly beautiful Mark, the four medallions representing scenes of
filial piety. His daughter was the mother of Sébastien Cramoisy,
“typographus regius,” who inherited the establishment of his
grandfather.
<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
<a name = "page129" id = "page129"> </a>
Of the somewhat crudely drawn Mark&mdash;an evident pun on his
surname&mdash;used in or about 1504, by Guillaume Du Puys, the sign of
the shop being the Samaritan, a&nbsp;much more decorative example was
used, in various sizes, by Jacques Du Puys (<a href =
"#fig11">p.&nbsp;<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘10’">11</ins></a>), who was a bookseller, 1549&ndash;91, rather than a
printer. Equally fine in another way is the tripartite example, given on
<a href = "#fig130">page 130</a>, used by Guillaume Merlin in
partnership with Guillaume Desboys and Sébastien Nivelle, in 1559, and
also with the latter in 1571. The Mark is the interpretation of the four
lines:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Veniet tempus meissionis.</p>
<p>Non oderis laboriosa opera.</p>

<p>After Paris, the next most important town in France, so far as
printers and their Marks are concerned, is Lyons. The first book printed
in this city is presumed to be “Cardinalis Lotharii Tractatus quinque,”
“Lugduni, Bartholomæus Buyerius,” 1473 (in quarto). The same printer
also published the first French translation of the Bible, by Julian
Macho and Pierre Ferget, which was executed between 1473 and 1474, from
which date the art of printing in Lyons increased by leaps and bounds.
Panzer notices over 250 works executed (by nearly forty printers) here
during the quarter of a century which followed. The most notable among
these is perhaps Josse Bade, to
<span class = "pagenum">131</span>
<a name = "page131" id = "page131"> </a>
whom we have already referred. The former of the two “honestes homes
Michelet topie de pymont: &amp; Iaques heremberck dalemaigne,” possessed
a Mark which may be regarded as one of the earliest, if not actually the
first, employed at Lyons. Topie and Heremberk printed the first edition
of the “Chronique Scandaleuse,” about 1488, and Breydenbach’s “Voyage à
Jerusalem,” of about the same period&mdash;the latter of which contains
the first examples of copper-plate engraving in France, the panorama of
Venice alone being sixty-four inches in length. Contemporary with
<span class = "pagenum">132</span>
<a name = "page132" id = "page132"> </a>
these, Johannes or Jehan Treschel deserves notice not only as an eminent
printer, but also as the father-in-law of one still more
eminent&mdash;Bade. Treschel’s illustrated edition of Terence, 1493, is
described as forming “the most striking and artistic work of
illustration produced by the early French school.” The most generally
known of all the Lyonese printers is Etienne Dolet, who, born at Orleans
in 1509, distinguished himself not only as a printer, but as a Latin
scholar, a&nbsp;poet, and an orator; he was burnt as an atheist in
August, 1546. Dolet, as Mr. Chancellor Christie tells us in his
exhaustive monograph, adopted a Mark and motto which are to be found in
all or nearly all the productions of his press. The Mark and the motto
are equally allusive: the former is an axe of the
<span class = "pagenum">133</span>
<a name = "page133" id = "page133"> </a>
kind known as <i>doloire</i>, held in a hand which is issuing out of a
cloud. Below is a portion of a trunk of a tree; it is usually surrounded
by the motto, “Scabra et impolita ad amussim dolo atque perfolia”; it is
often also surrounded by an ornamental woodcut border, as in the
accompanying illustration; and in some cases the words “scabra dolo” are
printed on the axe.</p>

<p>Two contemporary Lyonese firms of printers, the De Tournes and De la
Portes, appear to have rivalled one another in the number of their
Marks. Jean De Tournes, 1542&ndash;50, himself had no less than eleven
Marks, several of which are exceedingly
<span class = "pagenum">134</span>
<a name = "page134" id = "page134"> </a>
graceful, one of the largest and best of which represents a sower, and
serves as an excellent pendant to the reaper of Jacques Roffet, both of
which appear in our first chapter. The seven or eight members of the De
la Porte family used at least half a score Marks between them. The
family, beginning with Aymé De la Porte in the last decade of the
fifteenth century, and ending with Sibylle De la Porte, were in business
first as printers, then as booksellers, for just a century; and the
punning device apparently originated, not
<span class = "pagenum">135</span>
<a name = "page135" id = "page135"> </a>
with the first member of the family, but with Jehan, who started a
business in Paris about 1508, and in his Mark the shield bears a
castellated doorway; the picture of the biblical Samson carrying off the
gates was apparently first used by Hugues De la Porte, who was a
bookseller at Lyons from 1530; this was superseded for the more
pictorial and considerably smaller example, here given, when he entered
into partnership with Antoine Vincent about 1559. Although the Du Prés
were Parisian printers, Jehan of that family issued several books at
Lyons during the last few years of the fifteenth century, and one of his
three Marks is given on <a href = "#fig108">p.&nbsp;108</a>.
<span class = "pagenum">136</span>
<a name = "page136" id = "page136"> </a>
Sébastien Gryphe, or Gryphius, who printed and published a large number
of works during the second quarter of the sixteenth century, was also
extravagant in the way of Marks, of which there are at least eight, all,
however, of one common type&mdash;the Griffin, sometimes quite without
any sort of decorative attributes or motto, and sometimes as in the
example here given.</p>

<p>So far as regards the French cities and towns, we have only space to
refer briefly to a few of the more important. After Paris and Lyons,
Toulouse was one of the earliest places in France in which
<span class = "pagenum">137</span>
<a name = "page137" id = "page137"> </a>
a&nbsp;printing-press was set up. Although not the first, Jacques
Colomies was one of the first, as he was one of the most prolific of the
early printers of Toulouse, working from 1530 to 1572. Printing was
established at Caen in 1480; but Pierre Chandelier, whose punning Mark
we give, did not start work until eighty years after its first
introduction. A&nbsp;punning device (<a href = "#fig7">p.&nbsp;7</a>),
also is that of Jehan Lecoq, who was printing at Troyes from about 1509
to 1530. The only Rouen printer to whom we shall refer is Martin Morin,
who appears to have been at work here as a printer from about
<span class = "pagenum">138</span>
<a name = "page138" id = "page138"> </a>
1484 to 1518, and of his Marks we give one example; another is formed of
a large initial M, decorated with a variety of grotesque heads, with the
surname Morin on the two central strokes of the letter.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Although</span> the early history of the
Printer’s Mark in Germany is neither extensive in variety nor startling
in surprises, there are still very many features of general interest.
And if the Printer’s Mark, as we have already seen, had its origin in
Mainz, its development is certainly due to the Strassburg craftsmen. As
no other city in Germany can show such a varied collection of beautiful
Marks, examples of the <ins class = "correction" title = "anomalous spelling">Strasburg</ins> printers will preponderate in this chapter. It
is now generally accepted that the art of printing was carried on in
Strassburg (Argentina, Argent-oratum), either in 1459 or 1460, by Johan
Mentelin, who appears to have continued in the business until 1476; and
about six years after he had started, Heinrich Eggestein commenced, and
continued until about 1478. Accepting the arrangement of Herr Paul
<span class = "pagenum">140</span>
<a name = "page140" id = "page140"> </a>
Heitz and Dr. Karl August Barack in their very elaborate “Elsässische
Büchermarken bis Anfang des <ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">18.</ins> Jahrhunderts,” the first <ins class = "correction"
title = "anomalous spelling">Strasburg</ins> printer to use a Mark was
Johann Grüninger, who, after working at Basel for a year or two, took up
his residence in Strassburg at the end of 1482. One of his first Marks
appeared in Brant’s “Narrenschiff,” 1494, and of this our example is an
elaboration. By the year 1525 he employed no less than five distinct
examples, the last of which, in Ptolemæus, “Geographicæ Enarrationes,”
1525, differs completely from all the others, the single letter G
occupying the centre of the masonic compass and rule. Grüninger, it may
be noted, was the printer of “Cosmographie Introductio,” 1509; the
second
<span class = "pagenum">141</span>
<a name = "page141" id = "page141"> </a>
edition of the famous book in which the name America was proposed and
used for the first time. He is further noted for the number of misprints
which occur in the books issued by him. The last book which bears his
imprint is apparently “Geberi philosophi ac alchimistæ maximi, de
Alchimia, libri tres,” March, 1529. Martin Schott’s distinct device is
found in at least three books of the date 1498, including Matheolus’
“Ars memorativa,” and was used by him until 1517. It was also used by
his son, Johann Schott, about 1541, the same printer using seven or
eight other Marks, all more or less distinct, at different periods. The
first book bearing Martin Schott’s name is dated 1491, and he continued
printing until 1499; while his son was in business from 1500 to 1545.
Equally distinct is the accompanying example&mdash;one of
<span class = "pagenum">142</span>
<a name = "page142" id = "page142"> </a>
several&mdash;used by Johann Knoblouch, which is found in the majority
of the books printed by him from about 1521 to 1526, notably several
works by Erasmus (<i>e.g.</i> “Moriæ Encomium,” 1522, and the “Novum
Testamentum,” 1523). The father started in 1497, and was succeeded by
his son, who continued the business until 1558. The Mark, it may be
mentioned, is a somewhat atrocious pun on the owner’s name, which is the
German for “garlic,” with the seed pods of which the figure
<span class = "pagenum">144</span>
<a name = "page144" id = "page144"> </a>
emblematically representing Ignorance ascending from darkness into light
is encircled; this Mark is generally surrounded by mottoes in Greek,
Hebrew, and Latin.</p>

<p>Although Reinhard, or Renatus, Beck was only in business for about
eleven years, 1511&ndash;1522, he had several Marks, which differed
chiefly in their extraneous ornament, as will be seen from the
accompanying examples. Two books, <i>sine nota</i>, which Mr. Quaritch
assigns to Beck’s press,
<span class = "pagenum">146</span>
<a name = "page146" id = "page146"> </a>
of the date 1490, are remarkable for the large number of woodcuts which
they contain, relating principally to plants, animals, gardening
operations, rural architecture, so that the Mark of “ein wilder Mann” is
so far in keeping with the nature of his publications. Fourteen or
fifteen Marks, several of which are only variations of one type, have
been identified as having been used by Wolfgang Köpfel (whose surname
sometimes appears in its Greek translation of Cephalæus) between 1522
and 1554: the most remarkable, of which we give a reproduction, appears
to have been used very rarely, notably in “Zehn Sermones” of Luther,
1523; a&nbsp;much commoner type is the smaller example, which appeared
in various books issued between 1526&ndash;1554. Georg Ullricher von
Andlau, 1529&ndash;36, confined himself to one type (see <a href =

Plenty, of which there are seven variants. The more elaborate of the two
Marks of Matthias Biener, or Apiarius, 1533&ndash;36, appears in
Oecolampadius’ “Commentarius” on the Prophet Ezekiel, 1534, and is an
evident pun on the printer’s surname. Several of the dozen Marks used by

<p>Wendelin Rihel was the founder of one of the longest-lived dynasties
of Strassburg printers, who were issuing books from 1535 to 1639; their
eighteen Marks have all the same subject, a&nbsp;winged figure of
Sophrosyne, holding in one hand a rule, and in the other a bridle and
halter. Of Thiebold Berger, who appears to have been in business
<span class = "pagenum">152</span>
<a name = "page152" id = "page152"> </a>
from 1551&ndash;1584, very little is known, either of his books or his
personality; his Mark is, however, pretty, and unique, so far as
Strassburg is concerned. Lazarus Zetzner and his successors, whose works
date from 1586 to 1648, and whose Marks number nearly thirty, all
variants of the example here given: it is a bust of Minerva supported on
a short square pedestal, on which is inscribed the words “Scientia
immutabilis.” This family printed a large number of works, from a
Lutheran Bible to Aretini’s “Historiæ Florentinæ.” As an example of a
rare and distinct Mark we give one of two employed by Conrad Scher,
1603&ndash;31, which was subsequently used by Johannes Reppius, also of
Strassburg. Curiosity is the only feature of the solitary example of
David Hauth, 1635.</p>

<p>But of all the Strassburg printers, there can be no doubt that, from
a strictly pictorial point of view, the Marks of Johann Reinhold
Dulssecker, 1696&ndash;1737, are by far the most beautiful. Indeed, in
many respects they are the most charming examples to be found among the
devices of any time or country. In some instances they partake much more
of the character of a vignette than a tradesman’s mark. His earliest
device is composed of his monogram; and his first decorative Mark is the
very beautiful little picture of an English
<span class = "pagenum">154</span>
<a name = "page154" id = "page154"> </a>
garden, in the central pathway of which occurs his initials. This Mark
appears to have been used in only one book, “M.&nbsp;Fabii Quinctiliani
Declamationes ... ex recensione Ulrici Obrechti,” 1698. A&nbsp;type of
Mark very frequently used by him occurs in Schilter’s “Scriptores Rerum
Germanicarum,” 1702, with his motto of “Dominus providebit,” and of this
Mark we give an excessively rare variant on <a href =
"#fig47">p.&nbsp;47</a>. He had eleven Marks, his list includes books of
all kinds, in Latin, German, and French.</p>

<p>Of the other Alsatian printers we have only
<span class = "pagenum">155</span>
<a name = "page155" id = "page155"> </a>
room to refer to two examples. Thomas Anshelm (or Anshelmi Badensis) is
perhaps the most eminent of the early Hagenau printers, his books dating
from 1488 to 1522, the earliest of which, however, were not printed at
this place. His Marks all carry the initials T A B, the Hebrew letters
in the accompanying example representing the name Jehovah; in his most
elegant Mark the same word is supported on a scroll by a cherub, whilst
another cherub is supporting a second scroll on which is inscribed the
word Jesus in Greek characters. The style and workmanship of this
woodcut suggest the hand of Hans Schaufelein, and it is worth noting
that in 1516 Anshelm produced “Doctrina Vita et Passio Jesu Christi,”
<span class = "pagenum">156</span>
<a name = "page156" id = "page156"> </a>
some of the illustrations of which were by Schaufelein. Anshelm issued a
large number of books, including the works of Pliny, Melancthon,
Erasmus, Cicero, etc. Valentin Kobian, 1532&ndash;42, inserted an
exceedingly original and striking Mark in the edition of Erasmus’
“Heroicum Carmen,” 1536, the Peacock with one foot on a Cock and the
other on a crouching Lion being highly effective.</p>

<p>Printing had not established itself at Cologne until four years later
than at Strassburg. Ulric Zell, at the dispersal of the Mainz printers,
settled himself in this city, where he was printing from about 1463 to
nearly the end of the fifteenth century. He was clearly not an
innovator, for he never printed a book in German, and did not adopt any
of the improvements of his <i>confrères</i> who had settled themselves
in Italy; he “rigidly adhered to the severe style of Schoeffer, printing
all his books from three sizes of a rude face of a
<span class = "pagenum">159</span>
<a name = "page159" id = "page159"> </a>
round gothic type.” It is not to him therefore that we can look for
anything in the way of Printers’ Marks, the earliest Cologne printer to
adopt which was apparently Arnold Ther Hoernen, whose colophons, of
which we give an example, were often printed in red. His Mark is a
triangle of which the two upright sides are prolonged with a crosslet;
in the centre a star, and on either side the gothic letters T H, the
whole being on a very small shield hanging from a broken stump. Herman
Bumgart, one of whose books bears the subscription “Gedruckt in Coelne
up den Alden Mart tzo dem wilden manne,” and who was in Cologne at the
latter end of the fifteenth century, has a special interest to us from
the probability that he was in some way connected with the early
Scottish printers.</p>

<p>Once started, the idea of the Mark was quickly taken up. Johann
Koelhoff, 1470&ndash;1500, the first printer to use printed signatures
(in his edition of Nyder, “Preceptorium divinæ legis,” 1472), came out
with a large but roughly drawn example, the arms of Cologne, consisting
of a knight’s helmet, with peacock feathers, crest, and elaborate
mantles, surmounting a shield with the three crowns in chief, the rest
of the escutcheon blank, and rabbits in the foreground. Koelhoff (who
describes himself “de Lubeck”) was the printer of the “Cologne
Chronicle,” 1499, and of an edition of “Bartholomæus de Proprietatibus
Rerum,” 1481. Several interesting Cologne Marks of the first years of
the sixteenth century may be noted. For instance, Eucharius Cervicornus,
1517&ndash;36, used a caduceus on an
<span class = "pagenum">161</span>
<a name = "page161" id = "page161"> </a>
ornamented shield, and printed among other books what is believed to be
the earliest edition of Maximilianus Transylvanus’ “De Moluccis
Insulis,” 1523, in which the discoveries of Ferdinand Magellan and the
earliest circumnavigation of the globe were announced. Like Koelhoff,
Nicolas Cæsar, or Kaiser, who was established as a printer at Cologne in
1518, used the Cologne arms as a Mark, which is sufficiently distinct
from the earlier example to be quoted here. Johann Soter, 1518&ndash;36,
is another exceedingly interesting personality in the early history of
Cologne printing. We give
<span class = "pagenum">162</span>
<a name = "page162" id = "page162"> </a>
the more elaborate of the two marks used by him and reproduced by
Berjeau: the shield contains the Rosicrucian triple triangle on the
threshold of a Renaissance door. During the latter end of his career at
Cologne, Soter had also an establishment at Solingen, where he printed
“several works of a description which rendered too hazardous their
publication in the former city.” Arnold Birckmann and his successors,
1562&ndash;92, used the accompanying Mark of a hen under a tree. After
Günther Zainer, 1468&ndash;77, who introduced printing into Augsburg,
the most notable typographer of this city is perhaps Erhart Ratdolt, to
whom reference is made in the chapter on Italian Marks. We
<span class = "pagenum">163</span>
<a name = "page163" id = "page163"> </a>
give the rather striking Mark&mdash;a&nbsp;white <i>fleur-de-lis</i> on
black ground springing from a globe&mdash;of Erhart Oglin, Augsburg,
1505&ndash;16, one of whose productions, by Conrad Reitter, 1508, is
remarkable as having a series of Death-Dance pictures; Hans Holbein was
eight years of age when it appeared, and was then living in his native
town of Augsburg.</p>

<p>For typographical purposes Switzerland may be regarded as an integral
portion of Germany, and it was to Basle that Berthold Rodt of Hanau, one
of <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Füst’s’">Fust’s</ins>workmen, is assumed to have brought the art about
the year 1467. One of the first Basle printers to adopt a Mark was
Jacobus De Pfortzheim, 1488&ndash;1518, who used two very distinct
examples, of which we give the more spirited, the left shield carrying
the arms of the city in which he was working. It appears for the first
time in
<span class = "pagenum">164</span>
<a name = "page164" id = "page164"> </a>
“Grammatica P.&nbsp;Francisci nigri A.&nbsp;Veneti sacerdoti oratoris,”
etc., 1500. The second Mark is emblematical of the Swiss warrior. The
most eminent of the Basle printers was however Johann Froben,
1490&ndash;1527, who numbered among his “readers” such men as Wolfgang
Lachner, Heiland, Musculus, Oecolampadius, and Erasmus. Very few, if
any, German works were printed by him; the first edition of the New
Testament in Greek was printed by him in 1516, Erasmus being the editor.
Froben’s device (to which lengthy reference
<span class = "pagenum">166</span>
<a name = "page166" id = "page166"> </a>
has already been made, and into a discussion of the extremely numerous
variants of which we need not enter here) led Erasmus to think that his
learned friend did indeed unite the wisdom of the serpent to the
simplicity of the dove (see <a href = "#fig43">p.&nbsp;43</a>). Two
other early Basle printers, Michael Furter, 1490&ndash;1517, and
Nicholas Lamparter, 1505&ndash;19, used Marks one shield of each of
which carried the arms of Basle. Henricpetri was a celebrated printer of
Basle, 1523&ndash;78, and had a Mark of quite a unique character,
representing Thor’s hammer, held by a
<span class = "pagenum">167</span>
<a name = "page167" id = "page167"> </a>
hand issuing from the clouds, striking fire on the rock, while a head,
symbolizing wind, blows upon it. To yet another distinguished Basle
printer, Cratander, reference is made, and his Mark given, in the second
chapter.</p>

<p>The most famous, as he was one of the earliest, if not actually the
first, printers of Nuremberg, or Nürnberg, Anthony Koberger, does not
appear to have used a Mark. Indeed, the Printers’ Marks of Nürnberg
generally do not make anything like so good a show as those of Cologne
and other large German cities. The earliest Mark of all is probably <ins

<span class = "pagenum">169</span>

who started here in 1503, and continued until 1513, when he removed to
Landshut, and remained there until 1531. He used the accompanying Mark
at both places,&mdash;the precise signification of the letters H H on
one side of the globe is not known. Mr. Quaritch describes a book of
<span class = "pagenum">170</span>

<p>Several of the Marks of the early printers of Leipzig, into which
printing was introduced in 1480, are of great interest and possess quite
a character of their own. One of the earliest, for example, is that of
Melchior Lotter, who issued a large number of books from 1491 to 1536.
The word “Lotter” is equivalent to “vagabond” in English, and the Mark
herewith consists of an emblem of a mendicant in a half-suppliant
posture. Melchior Lotter junior was printing at Wittenberg from 1520 to
1524, where he printed anonymously the first edition of Luther’s Bible,
with illustrations by Lucas Cranach,
<span class = "pagenum">171</span>
<a name = "page171" id = "page171"> </a>
1522, which an enthusiastic <ins class = "correction" title =
"bookseller, not bibliophile">bibliopole</ins> has described as “one of
the great works of the world.” Valentin Schumann, 1502&ndash;34 (and
probably much later), is another eminent Leipzig printer, being the
first to attempt printing in Hebrew characters in a Hebrew grammar,
1520. The initials L D on his Mark are taken to signify “Lipsiensis
Demander” or Damander, a&nbsp;rude Latinization of Schumann which he
sometimes used. Sufficiently quaint also is the Mark of Jacobus Thanner,
1501&ndash;21, which forms the initial to the present chapter. By 1500
printing had reached to Olmütz, where Conrad Baumgarten was issuing
until 1502 works chiefly levelled against the Church of Rome; from 1503
to 1505 the same printer had established
<span class = "pagenum">172</span>
<a name = "page172" id = "page172"> </a>
himself in Breslau, which he again changed for Frankfort-am-Oder,
1507&ndash;14, removing again in the latter year to Leipzig. The W on
one of the shields of his Mark is the initial of Wratislau, the Polish
name of Breslau, and the female saint on the other shows the arms of the
town. It appears to be uncertain whether printing was introduced into
Frankfort-am-Main in 1511 or 1530; but the only Mark which we need quote
is that of Johann <ins class = "correction" title = "picture caption has ‘Feyrabend’">Feyrabendt</ins>, whose chief interest to posterity lies in
the fact that he printed Jost Ammon’s “Künstliche wohlgerissene neu
Figuren von allerley Jagtkunst,” 1592: his Mark is emblematical of Fame,
winged, blowing a German horn, and enclosed in a cartouche. Andreas
Wechel was printing at Frankfort from 1573 to 1581, his Mark being the
well-known one of the Pegasus. Although Jacob Stadelberger, Heidelberg,
was not by any means an eminent printer, his Mark is well
<span class = "pagenum">173</span>
<a name = "page173" id = "page173"> </a>
worthy of note: it consists of three shields, the right of which bears
the arms of Bavaria, the left a lion rampant, the arms of Heidelberg,
and that of the middle is supposed to represent the arms of Zurich.</p>

<p>Adam Steinschawer is said to be the printer of the first book issued
at Geneva, in 1479; soon after him came Guerbin, 1482, whose Mark we
give after Bouchot. From about 1537 to 1554 Jehan Girard, or Gerard, was
busy printing books here; the Mark
<span class = "pagenum">174</span>
<a name = "page174" id = "page174"> </a>
herewith comes from one of Calvin’s books, 1545, the Latin motto being
anglicized thus: “I&nbsp;came not to send peace, but a sword,”
a&nbsp;very proper motto indeed for such an author. Girard used three
other Marks of this type. The position of Geneva in literature is French
rather than German, and this also holds good with regard to its
typographical annals. The accompanying Mark of Jean Rivery, Geneva,
1556&ndash;64, is distinct of its kind, and is the smaller of the two
examples used by this printer; in the larger one, the same motto
appears, but in roman type, not italic; there are also only two trees,
both nearly leafless; the hand holding an axe occurs in both examples.
Many French printers, for various reasons, and at different times,
“retired” to Geneva, as, for example, the Estiennes; the Marks of
several Franco-Genevan printers therefore will be found dealt with in
the previous
<span class = "pagenum">175</span>
<a name = "page175" id = "page175"> </a>
chapter. Although printing appears to have been introduced into Zurich
in 1508, books executed at this place prior to 1523 are excessively
rare. Christopherus Froschover, 1523&ndash;48, was by far the most
eminent and prolific of the early Zurich printers; to him has been
attributed the production of the first English Bible. His Mark is a
punning one, <i>Frosch</i> being German for “frog;” it is emblematical
of a gigantic frog ridden by a child under
<span class = "pagenum">176</span>
<a name = "page176" id = "page176"> </a>
a&nbsp;tree, the “larger growth” being surrounded by several of the
normal size. Of other Swiss printers whose Marks we reproduce, but to
whom we can make no further reference, are Nicolas Brylinger, Basle,
1536&ndash;65 (the accompanying example is taken from the title-page of
“Pantalonis Henrici, Prosopographiæ Heroum atque illustrium Virorum
totius Germaniæ,” 1565, a&nbsp;folio of three volumes, full of
fancifully drawn portraits, the same portrait being often used for
several men), and F.&nbsp;Le Preux, of Lausanne, Morges, and Berne.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> introduction of the art of
printing into the Low Countries, and the rival claim of Coster and
Gutenberg, have proved a highly fruitful source of literary quarrels and
disputations. It is not worth our while to enter, even briefly, into the
merits of the arguments either for or against; and it will suffice for
our present purpose to regard Johann Veldener, 1473&ndash;7, as the
first printer. He was probably a pupil of Ulric Zell, and, like many
others of the early Netherland printers, he does not appear to have
remained long at one place. For example, he was at Louvain from
1473&ndash;7, at Utrecht 1478&ndash;81, and at Culemberg, 1482&ndash;4.
His only Mark appears to be that given herewith, in which his name in an
abbreviated form occurs between the
<span class = "pagenum">179</span>
<a name = "page179" id = "page179"> </a>
two shields, on the right one of which appears the arms of Louvain. His
most notable publications were two quarto editions of the “Speculum” in
the Dutch language, one of which contained 116 and the other 128
illustrations, “printed from the woodcuts that had been previously used
in the four notable editions; to make these broad woodcuts, which had
been designed for pages in folio, Veldener cut away the architectural
framework surrounding each illustration and then sawed each block in two
pieces.” He received from the University the honorary title of Master of
Printing, an honour which was also conferred on his more distinguished
contemporary, Johann of Westphalia, 1474&ndash;96, for whom in fact is
claimed the priority of the introduction of printing into Louvain. The
first of the large number of books produced by the latter is by Petrus
de Crescentiis, “Incipit liber ruraliū cōmodorū,” 1474, its colophon
being printed in red. The accompanying exceedingly curious
“souscription,” with portrait of the printer, is given from Lambinet’s
“Recherches.”

Thierry Martens, or Mertens, or Martin d’Alost (Theodoricus Martinus),
may be regarded either as an early printer of Louvain, Antwerp, or
Alost, for it is stated that he had presses working simultaneously at
the three places; but Alost has the first claims, and it is said that he
was printing here in 1473, although as a matter of fact he was only
twenty years of age at this period. He was a distinguished scholar, and
the friend of Barland

Bruges, for an exhaustive account of whose connection with William
Caxton the reader is referred to Mr. Blades’s monograph, used several
Marks, printed in red and black, and similar to the example here
given.</p>

<p>In many respects the “Clercs ou Frères de la vie Commune” (Fratres
vitæ communis), who were printing at Brussels from 1476 to 1487, form
one of the most interesting features in the
<span class = "pagenum">183</span>

early history of printing in the Low Countries. The types which they
used resemble very much those of Arnold Ther Hoernen, Cologne; and the
only book, “diligentia impresse in famosa civitate Bruxellen,” to which
they put their name, is entitled “Legendæ Sanctorum Henrici Imperatoris
et Kunegundis Imperatricis,” etc., 1484, and this is their only
illustrated book. “Their productions illustrate the stage of transition
between the ancient scribe and printer by showing how naturally one

printer was Richard Paffroed (the surname has about thirty variations)
in 1477, who was either a pupil of Ulric Zell or Ther Hoernen, and who
continued there until the first year of the sixteenth century, and was
apparently succeeded by his youngest son Albertus, who was printing
there up to about 1530, and whose Mark we give.</p>

<p>So far as Gouda is concerned, Gheraert or Gerard Leeu and early
printing are synonymous. He was a native of this place, and established
himself here as a printer in 1477 and continued up to 1484, when he
removed his presses to Antwerp, where he was printing until the year of
his death, 1493. His “Dialogus Creaturarum,” the first edition of which
appeared in 1480, had run into over a dozen editions, in Latin or Dutch,
by the first year of the sixteenth century. Whilst at Gouda Leeu used
several marks, of which the smaller, given on <a href =
"#fig39">p.&nbsp;39</a>, was printed in red and black; at Antwerp he
used a much more ambitious example, consisting of the arms of the Castle
of Antwerp: a&nbsp;battlement and a turreted gate, with two smaller ones
on either side; the two large flags bear the arms of the German Empire
and of the Archduke Maximilian of Austria. Nicolas Leeu, who was
printing at Antwerp in 1487&ndash;8, was possibly the
<span class = "pagenum">186</span>
<a name = "page186" id = "page186"> </a>
brother of the more famous typographer, and his Mark consists of the
lion (a&nbsp;pun on his surname, which is equivalent to lion) in a
Gothic window holding two shields, with the arms of Antwerp on the left
and the monogram of Gheraert Leeu on the right. Like Leeu and so many of
the other early Dutch printers, the first Delft typographer, Jacob
Jacobzoon Van der Meer, 1477&ndash;87, employed the arms of the town in
which he printed on his Mark, the right shield in the present instance
carrying three water-lily leaves. In 1477 he issued an edition of the
Dutch Bible, and three years later the first edition of the Psalter,
“Die Duytsche Souter,” which had been omitted from the Bible. The only
other Delft printer to whom we need refer is Christian Snellaert,
1495&ndash;7, the only book to which he has placed both his name and his
Mark being “Theobaldus Physiologus de naturis duodecim animalium,” 1495.
His most remarkable production, however, is a “Missale
<span class = "pagenum">188</span>
<a name = "page188" id = "page188"> </a>
secundum Ordinarium Trajactense,” issued about 1497; this Mark, given on
<a href = "#fig35">p.&nbsp;35</a>, was also used by Henri Eckert van
Hombergh, who was printing at Antwerp from 1500 to 1519: the shield
carries the arms of Antwerp; in the arms of Snellaert this shield is
blank, and this constitutes the only difference between the two
Marks.</p>

<p>If it could be proved that “Het boeck van Tondalus visioen” was, as
has been stated, printed at Antwerp in 1472, by Mathias Van der Goes,
the claim of Antwerp to be regarded as the first place in the Low
Countries in which printing was introduced would be irrefutable.
Unfortunately there is very little doubt but that the date is an error,
although Goes is still rightly regarded as having introduced printing
into Antwerp, where he was issuing books from 1482 to about 1494 in
Dutch and Latin. He had two large Marks, one of which was a ship,
apparently emblematical of Progress or commercial enterprise, and the
other, a&nbsp;savage brandishing a club and bearing arms of
<span class = "pagenum">189</span>
<a name = "page189" id = "page189"> </a>
Brabant,&mdash;the latter, from “Sermones Quatuor Novissimorum,” 1487,
is here given. Rolant Van den Dorp, 1494&ndash;1500, whose chief claim
to fame is that he printed the “Cronyke van Brabant,” folio, Antwerp,
1497, had as his most ambitious Mark a charming picture of Roland
blowing his horn; on one of the shields (suspended from the branch of a
tree) is the arms of Antwerp, which he sometimes used separately as his
device. Contemporaneously with Van den Dorp, 1493&ndash;1500, we have
Godefroy Back, a&nbsp;binder who, on November 19, 1492, married the
widow of Van der Goes, and continued the printing-office of his
predecessor. His house was called the Vogehuis, and had for its sign the
Birdcage, which he adopted as his Mark; this he modified several times,
notably in 1496, when the monogram of Van der Goes was replaced by his
own. In the accompanying example (apparently broken during the printing)
the letter M is surmounted by the Burgundy device&mdash;a&nbsp;wand
upholding a St. Andrew’s cross. We give also a small example of the two
other Marks used by this printer. Arnoldus Cæsaris, l’Empereur, or De
Keysere, according as his name happened to be spelt in Latin, French, or
Flemish, is another of the early Antwerp printers whose mark is
sufficiently distinct to merit insertion here. His first book is dated
1480, “Hermanni de Petra Sermones super orationem dominicam.” Michael
Hellenius, 1514&ndash;36, is a printer of this city who has a special
interest to Englishmen from the fact that “in 1531 he printed at Antwerp
an anti-Protestant work for Henry Pepwell, who could
<span class = "pagenum">191</span>
<a name = "page191" id = "page191"> </a>
find no printer in London with sufficient courage to undertake it.”
Hellenius’ Mark is emblematical of Time, in which the figure is standing
on clouds, with a sickle in one hand and a serpent coiled in a circle on
the left. The Mark of Jan Steels, Antwerp (<a href =
"#fig19">p.&nbsp;19</a>), 1533&ndash;75, is regarded by some
bibliographers as the emblem of an altar, but “from the entire absence
of any ritual accessories, and the introduction of incongruous figures
(which no mediæval artist would have thought of representing), it would
appear to be merely a stone table.” Jacobus Bellaert, 1483&ndash;86, was
the first Haarlem printer, one of his earliest works being “Dat liden
ende die passie ons Heeren Jesu Christi,” which is dated December 10,
1483. Bellaert’s name does not
<span class = "pagenum">192</span>
<a name = "page192" id = "page192"> </a>
appear in it, but his Mark at the end permits of an easy identification,
it being the same as that which appears in his Dutch edition of
“Glanvilla de Proprietatibus Rerum,” 1485: the arms above the Griffin
are those of the city of Haarlem. One of the most famous printing
localities of the Low Countries was Leyden (Lugdunum Batavorum), where
the art was practised so early as 1483, Heynricus Henrici, 1483&ndash;4,
being one of the
<span class = "pagenum">194</span>
<a name = "page194" id = "page194"> </a>
earliest, his Mark carrying two shields, one of which bears the cross
keys of Leyden. The Pelican is an exceedingly rare element in Dutch and
Flemish Printers’ Marks, one of the very few exceptions being that of
J.&nbsp;Destresius, Ypres, 1553, the motto on the border reading “Sine
sanguinis effusione non fit remissio.”</p>

<p>It will be convenient to group together in this place a few of the
more representative examples of the Marks of the Dutch and Flemish
printers of the sixteenth century. Of Thomas Van der Noot, who was
printing at Brussels from about 1508 to 1517, there is very little of
general interest to state, but his large Mark is well worthy of a place
here. Picturesque in another way also is the Mark of J.&nbsp;Grapheus,
Antwerp, 1520&ndash;61; the
<span class = "pagenum">195</span>
<a name = "page195" id = "page195"> </a>
example we give is a distinct improvement on a very roughly drawn Mark
which this printer sometimes used, which is identical in every respect
to this, except that it has no borders. It is one of the few purely
pictorial, as distinct from armorial, Marks which we find used at
Antwerp in the earlier half of the sixteenth century. One of this
printer’s most notable publications is “Le Nouueau Testament de nostre
<ins class = "correction" title = "spelling unchanged">Sauflueur</ins>
Iesu Christ trāslate selon le vray text en franchois,” 1532,
a&nbsp;duodecimo of xviii and 354 folios, a&nbsp;rare impression of Le
Fèvre d’Etaples’ Testament as it had been issued by L’Empereur, in 1530,
who had obtained the licence of the Emperor and the Inquisition for this
impression. Henri Van den Keere, a&nbsp;book-seller
<span class = "pagenum">197</span>
<a name = "page197" id = "page197"> </a>
and printer of Ghent, 1549&ndash;58, had four Marks, all of which
resemble more or less closely the rather striking and certainly distinct
example here given. Of the Bruges printers of the sixteenth century,
Huber or Hubert Goltz, 1563&ndash;79, is
<span class = "pagenum">198</span>
<a name = "page198" id = "page198"> </a>
perhaps the most eminent, not so much on account of the typographical
phase of his career, as because of his works as an author and artist.
The “Fasti Magistratum et Triumphorum Romanorum,” is one of his books
best known to scholars, whilst to students of numismatics his work on
the medals from the time of Julius Cæsar to that of the Emperor
Ferdinand, in Latin, of which a very rare French edition appeared at
Antwerp in 1561, is well known, and the original edition of his works in
this respect is still highly esteemed, although, as
<span class = "pagenum">200</span>
<a name = "page200" id = "page200"> </a>
Brunet points out, Goltz has suffered a good deal in reputation since
Eckel has demonstrated that he included a number of spurious examples,
whilst some others are incorrectly copied. His interesting typographical
Mark is given on <a href = "#fig51">p.&nbsp;51</a>. J.&nbsp;Waesberghe,
of Antwerp and Rotterdam, had at least three Marks, of which we give the
largest example, and all of which are of a nautical character, the
centre being occupied by a mermaid carrying a horn of plenty; in the
smaller example of the accompanying Mark, the background is taken up by
a serpent forming a circle. The Mark of M.&nbsp;De Hamont,
a&nbsp;printer and bookseller of Brussels, 1569&ndash;77, is worth
quoting as one of the very few instances in which the subject of St.
George and the Dragon is utilized in this particular by a printer of the
Low Countries. Rutger Velpius appears to have had all the wandering
proclivities of the early printers; for
<span class = "pagenum">201</span>
<a name = "page201" id = "page201"> </a>
instance, we find him at Louvain from 1553 to 1580, at Mons from 1580 to
1585, and Brussels from 1585 to 1614: he had three Marks, of which we
give the largest. Of the Liege printers, we have only space to mention
J.&nbsp;Mathiæ Hovii, whose shop was “Ad insigne Paradisi Terrestris”
<span class = "pagenum">202</span>
<a name = "page202" id = "page202"> </a>
during the latter half of the seventeenth century, and whose Mark is of
rather striking originality and boldness of design.</p>

<p>The two most distinguished names in the annals of Dutch and Flemish
printing are unquestionably
<span class = "pagenum">&nbsp;<br>203</span>
<a name = "page203" id = "page203"> </a>
Plantin and the Elzevirs. A&nbsp;full description of the various Marks
used by Christophe Plantin alone would fill a small volume, as the
number is not only very great, but the varieties somewhat conflicting in
their resemblance to one another; all of them, however, are distinctly
traceable to three common types. Some are engraved by Godefroid Ballain,
Pierre Huys, and other distinguished craftsmen. His first Mark appeared
in the second book which he printed, the “Flores de L.&nbsp;Anneo
Seneca,” 1555. His second Mark was first used in the following year, and
bears the monogram of Arnaud Nicolaï. Of each of these examples we give
reproductions, as also of the fine example designed for Plantin’s
successors either by Rubens or by Erasme Quellin, and engraved by Jean
Christophe Jegher, 1639, Plantin having died in 1589. The most famous of
all Plantin’s Marks is
<span class = "pagenum">205</span>
<a name = "page205" id = "page205"> </a>
of course that with the compass and the motto “Labor et Constantia,”
which he first used in 1557. Plantin explains in the preface to his
Polyglot Bible the signification of this Mark, and states that the
compass is a symbolical representation of his device: the point of the
compass turning round signifies work, and the stationary point
constancy. One of the most curious combinations of Printers’ Marks may
be here alluded to: in 1573, Plantin, Steels and Nutius projected an
edition of the “Decretals,” and the Mark on this is made up of the three
used by these printers, and was designed by Pierre Van der Borcht.</p>

<p>Nearly every volume admittedly printed by the Elzevir family
possessed a Mark, of which this family, from Louis, in 1583, to Daniel,
1680, used four distinct examples. The founder of the dynasty, Louis
(1583&ndash;1617), adopted as his sign or mark an Eagle on a cippus with
a bundle of arrows, accompanied with the motto, “Concordia res parvæ
crescunt”&mdash;the emblem of the device of the Batavian
Republic&mdash;and as the year 1595 occurs on the primitive type of this
Mark, it might be concluded to date from that period. But Willems points
out that no book published by Louis in the years 1595 and 1596 carries
this Mark, which (he says) figures for the first time on the Meursius,
“Ad Theocriti idyllia Spicelegium,” 1597. In 1612 Louis Elzevir reduced
this Mark, and suppressed the date above mentioned. For some time Isaac
continued the use of the sign of his grandfather, and even after 1620,
when he adopted a new Mark&mdash;that of the Sage or Hermit&mdash;he
<span class = "pagenum">206</span>
<a name = "page206" id = "page206"> </a>
did not completely repudiate it. Bonaventure and Abraham scarcely ever
used it except for their catalogues.</p>

<p>The second Mark, which Isaac (1617&ndash;25) adopted in 1620, it
occurring for the first time in the “Acta Synodi Nationalis,” is known
as the Solitaire and sometimes as the Hermit or Sage. It represents an
elm around the trunk of which a vine, carrying bunches of grapes, is
twined; the Solitaire and the motto “Non solus.” The explanation of this
Mark is obvious, and may be summed up in the one word “Concord;” the
solitary individual is symbolical of the preference of the wise for
solitude&mdash;“Je suis seul en ce lieu être solitaire.” This Mark was
the principal one of the Leyden office, and was in constant use from
1620 to 1712, long after the Elzevirs had ceased to print.</p>

<p>The third Elzevir Mark consists of a Palm with the motto “Assurgo
pressa.” It was the Mark of Erpenius, professor of oriental languages at
the University of Leyden, who had established a printing-press which he
superintended himself in
<span class = "pagenum">207</span>
<a name = "page207" id = "page207"> </a>
his own house. At his death the Elzevirs acquired his material, with the
Mark, which occurs on the Elmacinus, “Historia Saracenica,” and on the
Syriac Psalter of 1625, on the “Meursii arboretum sacrum,” 1642, and on
about seven other volumes.</p>

<p>The fourth important Elzevir Mark is the Minerva with her attributes,
the breastplate, the olive tree, and the owl, and the motto “Ne extra
solus,” which is from a passage in the “Frogs” of Aristophanes. It was
one of the principal Marks of the Amsterdam office, and was used for the
first time by Louis Elzevir in 1642. After Daniel’s death this Mark
became the property of Henry Wetstein, who used it on some of his books.
It was also used by Thiboust at Paris and Theodoric van Ackersdyck at
Utrecht.</p>

<p>In addition to the foregoing, a number of other Marks were employed
by this firm of printers, the most important of the minor examples being
the Sphere, which occurs for the first time on “Sphæra Johannis de
Sacro-Bosco,” 1626, printed by
<span class = "pagenum">208</span>
<a name = "page208" id = "page208"> </a>
Bonaventure and Abraham; and from this time to the end of the period of
the operations of the Elzevirs, the Sphere and the Minerva appear to
have equally shared the honour of appearing on their title-pages. Among
the other Marks which we must be content to enumerate are the following:
a&nbsp;hand with the device of “Æqvabilitate,” an angel with a book, and
a book of music opened, each of which was used occasionally by the first
Elzevir; and one in which two hands are holding a cornucopia, of Isaac;
the arms of the Leyden University formed also occasionally the Mark of
the Elzevirs established in that city.</p>

<p>The Mark of Guislain Janssens, a bookseller and printer of Antwerp,
at the end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century, is
both distinct and pretty, and is worth notice if only from the fact that
artistic examples are by no means common with the printers of this
city.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> <i>incunabula</i> of Italy offer
very little interest so far as regards the Marks of their printers, and
the adoption of these devices did not become at all general until the
early years of the sixteenth century. Conrad Sweynheim and Arnold
Pannartz, who were the first to introduce printing from Germany into
Italy, first at the monastery of Subiaco, near Rome, in 1465, and to
that city in 1467, appear to have had no Mark; and the same may be said
of several of their successors. We give the earliest
<span class = "pagenum">210</span>
<a name = "page210" id = "page210"> </a>
Roman example with which we are acquainted, namely, that of Sixtus
Riessinger, and George Herolt, a&nbsp;German, who printed in partnership
at Rome in 1481 and 1483. One of the books produced by this partnership
was the “Tractatus sollemnis et utilis,” etc., which contains “full-page
figures of the Sybils, fine initials, and an interlaced border to the
first page of text, all executed in wood engraving.” The next Roman
typographers who used a Mark were, like Herolt, “Almanos” or Germans,
for as such Johann Besicken (1484&ndash;1506) and Martens of Amsterdam
describe themselves in the colophon of “Mirabilia Romæ,” a&nbsp;24mo. of
63 leaves, 1500. This work contains ten woodcuts, of which that on “the
<span class = "pagenum">211</span>
<a name = "page211" id = "page211"> </a>
reverse of leaf 36 has at the bottom the words ‘Mar’ and ‘De Amstdam’ in
black letters on white scrolls, and ‘<span class =
"smallcaps">Er</span>’ immediately beneath the latter, in white letters
on a black ground, showing that Martin of Amsterdam, one of the
printers, was also the engraver. On the woodcut on the reverse of leaf
25 also, there is a shield with the initials of both printers, ‘I’ and
‘M’ interlaced, in both large and small letters.” Andreas Fritag de
Argentina (or Strassburg), 1492&ndash;96, is another early Roman printer
who used a Mark. The four foregoing Marks are given on the authority of
J.&nbsp;J. Audiffredi, “Catalogus ... Romanorum Editionum saeculi XVI.,”
1783. Among the early sixteenth century printers of Rome, one of the
most distinguished was Zacharias Kalliergos of Crete, 1509&ndash;23, who
had started printing at Venice in 1499, and of whom Beloe has given an
interesting account in the fifth volume of his “Anecdotes of
Literature.” A&nbsp;miniature of his device is given at the end of this
chapter.</p>

<p>Printing was introduced into Venice by Johannes de Spira in 1469,
and, as showing the extent to which it was quickly carried, Panzer
reckons that
<span class = "pagenum">212</span>
<a name = "page212" id = "page212"> </a>
up to the end of the fifteenth century, no fewer than 189 printers had
established themselves here, and had issued close upon 3,000 works. From
1469 to 1480, over sixty master printers were
<span class = "pagenum">213</span>
<a name = "page213" id = "page213"> </a>
found within the precincts of the city. The first of the superb series
of early printed books produced here is the folio edition of Cicero,
“Epistolæ ad Familiares,” 1469, although the honour of being the most
magnificent production appears to be equally divided between the Livy
and the Virgil, 1470, executed by John of Spira’s brother and successor
Vindelinus. So far as we know, neither of the two brothers, nor Nicolas
Jenson, 1470&ndash;88, many of whose beautiful books rivalled the De
Spiras’, used a Mark.</p>

<p class = "caption">ERHARDUS RATDOLT.</p>

<p>Erhardus Ratdolt may be regarded as one of the earliest, if not
actually the first Venetian printer to adopt a Mark. From 1476 to 1478
he was in partnership with Bernardus Pictor and Petrus Loslein de
Langencen, but from the latter year to 1485 he was exercising the art
alone. (It is not altogether foreign to our subject to mention that this
firm printed the “Calendar” of John de Monteregio, 1476, which has the
first ornamental title known.) In 1487, Ratdolt was at Augsburg, and
perhaps his claims as a printer are German rather than Venetian, but as
his best work was executed during his sojourn in Venice, it will be more
convenient to include him in the present chapter. Like so many others of
the early printers, he regarded his own performances with no little
self-complacency, for in his colophons he describes himself, “Vir
solertissimus, imprimendi arte nominatissimus, artis impressoriæ
magister apprimè famosus, perpolitus opifex, vir sub orbe notus,” and so
forth. To him is attributed the credit of having invented ink of a
golden colour; and he
<span class = "pagenum">214</span>
<a name = "page214" id = "page214"> </a>
was the first to employ the “flourishes,” (“literæ florentes”) or
initial letters formed of floral scrolls and ornaments borrowed from the
Italian manuscripts, and sometimes printed in red and sometimes in
black. Joannes and Gregorius de Gregoriis, 1480<ins class = "correction"
title = "printed with long dash">&ndash;</ins>1516, and Gregorius alone,
1516&ndash;28, make a very good show in the way of printed books, one of
the most notable being the first quarto edition of Boccaccio, 1516, and
another the
<span class = "pagenum">215</span>
<a name = "page215" id = "page215"> </a>
“Deutsch Römisch Brevier,” 1518, which is printed in black and red
Gothic letter with numerous full-page woodcuts and borders. Contemporary
with these two brothers and also famous as a prolific printer comes
Ottaviano Scotto, “Civis Modoetiēsis,” 1480&ndash;1500, and his heirs,
1500&ndash;31, of whose Mark we give an exact reproduction. Baptista de
Tortis, 1481&ndash;1514, also issued a number of interesting books, more
particularly folio editions of the classics, copies of which are still
frequently met with, and of whose Mark we give a reduced example on
<a href = "#fig25">p.&nbsp;25</a>; and the same may be said of Bernardinus
Stagninus, 1483&ndash;1536. The Mark, also, of Bernardinus de Vitalibus,
1494&ndash;1500, is sufficiently distinct to justify a reduced example.
Bartholomeus de Zanis, 1486&ndash;1500, was not only a prolific printer
on his own account, but also for Scotto, to whom reference is made
above. The Marks, on a greatly reduced scale of Dionysius Bertochus,
1480; of Laurentius Rubeus de Valentia, 1482; of Nicholas de
Francfordia, 1473&ndash;1500; and of Peregrino de Pasqualibus,
1483&ndash;94, who was for a short time in partnership with Dionysius de
Bertochus, are all interesting as more or less distinct variations of
one common type (see <a href = "#fig25">p.&nbsp;25</a>). Of Petrus
Liechtenstein, 1497&ndash;1522, who describes himself as “Coloniensis,”
and whose very fine Mark in red and black forms the frontispiece to the
present volume, it will be only necessary to refer to one of his books,
the “Biblij Czeska,” 1506, which is the first edition for the use of the
Hussites. Of this exceedingly rare edition, only about four copies are
known. It is
<span class = "pagenum">217</span>
<a name = "page217" id = "page217"> </a>
remarkable in not having been suppressed by the Church, for one example
of its numerous woodcuts (which are coloured) at once betrays its
character, viz., the engraving to the sixth chapter of the Apocalypse,
in which the Pope appears lying in hell. As illustrative of some of the
more elaborate and pictorial Marks which one finds in the books of the
Venetian printers during the sixteenth century, we give a couple of very
distinct examples, the first being one of the Marks of the Sessa family,
whose works date from 1501 to 1588; and the second example
distinguishing the books of the brothers Paulum and Antonium Meietos,
who were printing books in 1570.</p>

<p>The Aldine family come at the head of the Venetian printers, not only
in the extreme beauty of their typographical work, but also in the
matter of Marks. The first (and rarest) production of the founder of the
dynasty, Aldus Manutius, 1494&ndash;1515, was “Musæi Opusculum de Herone
&amp; Leandro,” 1494, a&nbsp;small quarto, and his life’s work as a
printer is seen in about 126 editions which are known to have been
issued by him. “I&nbsp;have made a vow,” writes Aldus, in his preface to
the “Greek Grammar” of Lascaris, “to devote my life to the public
service, and God is my witness that such is my most ardent desire. To a
life of ease and quiet I have preferred one of restless labour. Man is
not born for pleasure, which is unworthy of the truly generous mind, but
for honourable labour. Let us leave to the vile herd the existence of
the brutes. Cato has compared the life
<span class = "pagenum">219</span>
<a name = "page219" id = "page219"> </a>
of man to the tool of iron: use it well, it shines, cease to use it and
it rusts.” It was not until 1502 that Aldus adopted a Mark, the
well-known anchor, and this appears for the first time in “Le Terze Rime
di Dante” (1502), which, being a duodecimo, is the first edition of
Dante in portable form. This Mark, and one or two others with very
slight alterations which naturally occurred in the process of being
re-engraved, was used up to the year 1546. In 1515 the original Aldus
died, and as his son Paolo or Paulus was only three years of age, Andrea
Torresano, a&nbsp;distinguished printer of Asola, into whose possession
the “plant” of Jenson had passed in 1481, and whose daughter married the
first Aldus, carried on the business of his deceased son-in-law, the
imprint running, “In ædibus Aldi et Andreæ Asulani soceri.” In 1540
Paulus Manutius took over the entire charge of the business founded by
his father. The Anchor,
<span class = "pagenum">220</span>
<a name = "page220" id = "page220"> </a>
known as the “Ancora grassa,” which he used from 1540 to 1546, is more
carefully engraved but less characteristic than that of his father;
whilst that which he used from 1546 to 1554 was usually but not
invariably surrounded by the decorative square indicated in the
accompanying reproduction; then he again modified his Mark, or more
particularly its border. Paulus Manutius died in April 1574. Aldus “the
younger,” 1574&ndash;98, the son of Paulus and the last representative
of the house, also used the anchor, the effect of which is to a great
extent destroyed by the elaborate coat-of-arms granted to the family by
the Emperor Maximilian. Aldus “the younger,” was a precocious scholar,
of the pedant type, and under him the traditions of the family rapidly
fell. He married into the eminent Giunta family of printers, and
<span class = "pagenum">221</span>
<a name = "page221" id = "page221"> </a>
died at the age of 49. The famous Mark of the anchor had been suggested
by the reverse of the beautiful silver medal of Vespasian,
a&nbsp;specimen of which had been presented to Aldus by his friend
Cardinal Bembo, the eminent printer, adding the Augustan motto, “Festina
lente.” The Mark of the dolphin anchor was used by many other printers
in Italy, France, Holland (Martens, Erasmus’ printer, among the number),
whilst the “Britannia” of Camden, 1586, printed by Newbery, bearing this
distinctive Mark, <ins class = "correction" title = "superfluous ‘which’ in original">which</ins> was likewise employed by Pickering in the early
part of the century; and, as will be seen from the next chapter, is
still employed by more than one printer.</p>

<p>The Giunta or Junta family, members of which were printing at
Florence and Venice from 1480 to 1598, may be conveniently referred to
here. One of the earliest books in which the founder of the family,
Filippo, used a Mark, is “Apuleii Metamorphoseos,” Florence, 1512; our
example, which is identical with that in Apuleius, is taken from <span
class = "greek" title = "Oppianou Halieutikôn">Ὀππιανου
Ἁλιευτικων</span> (Oppiani de natura seu venatione piscium), Florence,
1515, which was edited by Musurus. From a typographical and artistic
point of view the books of Lucantonio Junta (or Zonta) are infinitely
superior to those of Filippo. He was both printer and engraver, and many
of the illustrations which appear in the
<span class = "pagenum">223</span>
<a name = "page223" id = "page223"> </a>
books he printed were executed by him. His Mark appeared as early as
1495 in red at the end of an edition of Livy which he appears to have
executed for Philippus Pincius, Venice, and again in red, this time on
the title-page, in another edition of the same author, done for
Bartholomeus de Zanis de Portesio, Venice, 1511. Each of these
productions contained a large number of beautiful woodcuts. Early in the
sixteenth century those “vero honesti viri” (as they modestly described
themselves), Jacobi and Francisci, were printing at Florence (“et
sociorum eius”), the accompanying mark being taken from a commentary on
Thomas Aquinas, 1531. It will be noticed that in the three marks of
different members of
<span class = "pagenum">224</span>
<a name = "page224" id = "page224"> </a>
the family the <i>fleur-de-lys</i> appears. Among the Venetian printers
of the beginning of the sixteenth century Johannes de Sabio et Fratres
may be mentioned, if only on account of their Mark which is given
herewith. Its explanation is certainly not obvious; and Bigmore and
Wyman’s suggestion that it is a punning device is not a correct one,
whilst the statement that the cabbage is of the “Savoy” variety is also
erroneous, for this variety has scarcely any stalks; for “Brasica” we
should read “Brassica.” In 1534, “M.&nbsp;Iwan Antonio de Nicolini de
Sabio” printed “Alas espesas de M.&nbsp;Zuan Batista Pedreçan,”
a&nbsp;<span class = "pagenum">225</span>
<a name = "page225" id = "page225"> </a>
rare and beautiful edition with woodcuts, and, in small folio, of
“Primaleon” in Spanish; and in 1535 Stephano da Sabio issued a
translation of “La Conquesta del Peru,” etc., of Francesco de Xeres.</p>

<p>Although not the first printer either at Cremona, where he started in
1492, or at Brescia, where he was printing from 1492 to 1502, Bernardino
de Missintis deserves mention among the typographers of the fifteenth
century. So far as regards the latter place, the Mark of Giammaria
Rizzardi, who was established in this city during the latter half of the
last century, is one of the most distinct, and was probably designed by
Turbini. Bonino de Boninis of Ragusa, was printing at Venice,
1478&ndash;1480,
<span class = "pagenum">226</span>
<a name = "page226" id = "page226"> </a>
at Verona, 1481&ndash;3, and afterwards removed to Brescia, where he was
printing until about 1491. The earliest known book printed at Modena (or
Mutine) is an edition of Virgil, executed by Johannes Vurster de
Campidonâ, 1475; but one of the best known printers of this city is
Dominico Rocociolo, or Richizola, 1481&ndash;1504, who was in
partnership with Antonio Miscomini, 1487&ndash;89.</p>

<p>Printing was introduced into Milan (Mediolanum) in 1469 or in the
year following, and from the numerous presses established in this city
before the end of the fifteenth century very many beautiful books were
issued. Gian Giacomo di Legnano

“Paesi novamente retrovati, et Novo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio
Florentino intitulato.” Bologna was also a busy printing centre from
1470 onwards; but it must suffice us to give the monograms of three of
the more noteworthy, namely, Hercules Nanni, 1492&ndash;4; Giovanni

<p>The Printers’ Marks of Spain (including Portugal) need not detain us
long. They cannot in any case be described as other than archaic, and
they are for the most part striking on account of the coarseness of
their design. A&nbsp;few examples are given in Fray Francisco Mendez’s
“Tipografica
<span class = "pagenum">229</span>
<a name = "page229" id = "page229"> </a>
Española,” of which the first and only volume appeared at Madrid in
1796; and of which a second edition, corrected and enlarged by Dionisio
Hidalgo, was published at the same city in 1861. As the latter writer
clearly points out “los del siglo XV., y&nbsp;aun hasta la mitad del
XVI. los mas eran estranjeros, como lo demuestran sus nombres y
apellidos, y&nbsp;algunos lo declaran espresamente en sus notas y
escudos.” These “estranjeros” were almost without exception Germans.</p>

<p>Valencia (or Valentia Edetanorum) was the first place in Spain into
which the art of printing was introduced; the earliest printers being
Alfonso Fernandez de Cordova and Lambert Palomar (or Palmart)
a&nbsp;German, whose names however do not appear on any publication
(according to Cotton) antecedent to the year 1478. Although not the
earliest of the Seville printers the four “alemanes, y&nbsp;compañeros,”
Paulo de Colonia, Juan Pegnicer de Nuremberga, Magno y Thomas, their
composite Mark is one of the first which appears on books printed in
Spain. It is of the cross type, with two circles, one within another,
the smaller divided into four compartments, each of which encircles the
initials of the four printers, “P” (the lower part of which is continued
so as to form an “L”), “I&nbsp;M T.” Among other books which they
printed is the “Vidas de los Varones ilustres de Plutarco.” In 1495,
Paulo de Colonia appears to have left the partnership, for the Mark
appeared with its inner circle divided into three compartments in which
the initials “I&nbsp;M” and “T” only appear. This firm continued
printing at Seville until the commencement

of the sixteenth century. Federico de Basilea (or, as his name appears
in the imprints of his books, Fadrique Aleman de Basilea) was busy
printing books at Burgos from the end of the fourteenth to the second
decade of the fifteenth century; his Mark, a&nbsp;cross resting on a
V-shaped ground, is a poor one, the motto being “sine causa nihil.” “En
mushos libros de los que imprimió puso su escudo,” observes Mendez; this
printer possesses an historic interest from the fact that he issued the
first <ins class = "correction" title = "text unchanged: missing ‘of’?">edition the</ins> unabridged “Chronicle of the Cid,”
1512&mdash;“Cronica del Famoso Cauallero Cid Ruy Diez Campeador,”
<span class = "pagenum">231</span>
<a name = "page231" id = "page231"> </a>
a&nbsp;book of the greatest rarity. One of the early printers of
Barcelona, Pedro Miguel, had a Mark, also of the cross type, the circle
surrounding the bottom of which is divided into three compartments, in
two of which occur his initials “P&nbsp;M.”</p>

<p>One of the most noteworthy names in the early annals of Spanish
printing is that of Juan de Rosembach de Haydellerich, who printed books
in Barcelona, 1493&ndash;8, and again at the beginning
<span class = "pagenum">232</span>
<a name = "page232" id = "page232"> </a>
of the sixteenth century; in Perpignan, 1500; in Tarragona, 1490, and in
Montserrat. In 1499 he printed at Tarragona the famous “Missal de aquel
Arzobispado,” which Mendez declares to be “muy recomendable por varias
circumstancias.” At Barcelona he printed in 1526 an edition of the
“Oficias de Cicero.” The Marks of this printer vary considerably, but
the example here reproduced may be regarded as a representative one. Of
the early Lisbon printers, Valentin Fernandez “de la Provincia de
Moravia” was probably the first to use a Mark (here reproduced), one of
his publications being the “Glosa sobre las Coplas” of Jorge Manrique,
1501.</p>

thirty reduced reproductions of Marks used for the most part by the
Italian printers. These are given after Orlandi (“Origine e Progressi
della Stampa,” 1722) and Horne (“Introduction to the Study of
Bibliography,” 1814), but several of the names are open to question from
the fact that the former author has given no account either of the

<p><span class = "dropcap">D</span><span class =
"firstword">uring</span> the past few years there has been a very
evident revival in the Printer’s Mark as a modern device, but the
interest has much more largely obtained among publishers than among
printers. We propose, therefore, to include in this chapter a few of the
more interesting examples of each class. On the score of antiquity the
Stationers’ Company may be first mentioned. Founded in 1403&mdash;nearly
three-quarters of a century before the introduction of
printing&mdash;its first charter was not received until May 4th, 1557,
during the reign of Mary. The number of “seditious and heretical books,
both in prose and verse,” that were daily issued for the propagation of
“very great and detestable heresies against the faith and sound Catholic
doctrine of Holy Mother the Church,” became so numerous, that the
government were
<span class = "pagenum">234</span>
<a name = "page234" id = "page234"> </a>
only too glad to “recognize” the Company, and to intrust it with the
most absolute power. The charter was to “provide a proper remedy,” or,
in other words, to check the fast-increasing number of publications so
bitter in their opposition to the Court religion. But, stringent and
emphatic as was this proclamation, its effect was almost <i>nil</i>. On
June 6th, 1558, another rigorous act was published from “our manor of
St. James,” and will be found in Strype’s “Ecclesiastical Memorials”
(ed. 1822, iii. part 2, pp. 130, 131). It had specific reference to the
illegality of seditious books imported, and others “covertly printed
within this realm,” whereby “not only God is dishonoured, but also
encouragement is given to disobey lawful princes and governors.” This
proclamation declared that not only those who possessed such
<span class = "pagenum">235</span>
<a name = "page235" id = "page235"> </a>
books, but also those who, on finding them, do not forthwith report the
same, should be dealt with as rebels. It will be seen, therefore, how
easy it was, in the absence of any fine definition, for books of
whatever character to be proscribed. There was no appeal against the
decision of the Stationers’ Hall representatives, who had the power
entirely in their own hands. A&nbsp;few months after Mary’s futile
attempt at checking the freedom of the press, a&nbsp;diametrically
objective change occurred, and with Elizabeth’s accession to the throne
in November, 1558, the licensed stationers conveniently veered around
and were as industrious in suppressing Catholic books as they had been a
few weeks previously in endeavouring to stamp out those of the new
religion. The history of the Stationers’ Company however has been so
frequently told that it need not be further entered upon here, and it
must suffice us to say that, after many vicissitudes, all the privileges
and monopolies had become neutralized by the end of the last century,
till it
<span class = "pagenum">236</span>
<a name = "page236" id = "page236"> </a>
had nothing left but the right to publish a common Latin primer and
almanacks, and the right to the latter monopoly was annulled after a
memorable speech of Erksine. The Company still continues to publish
almanacks, and uses the two Marks or Arms here reproduced. The larger
example is the older, and is used on the County almanacks; whilst the
smaller one is used on circulars and notices.</p>

<p>Of the existing firms of publishers and printers, that of Messrs.
Longmans is the most memorable; <i>vice</i> the firm of Messrs.
Rivingtons, which has now become joined to that of the Longmans. This
gives us the opportunity to consider briefly the Marks of the two firms
together. In the year 1711, Richard Chiswell, the printer of much of
Dryden’s poetry, died, and his business passed into the hands of Charles
Rivington, a&nbsp;native of Chesterfield, Derbyshire. Thoughtful and
pious himself, Charles Rivington threw himself with ardour into the
trade for religious manuals, and not only succeeding in persuading John
Wesley to translate “à&nbsp;Kempis” for him, but also in publishing the
saintly Bishop Thomas Wilson’s “Short and Plain Introduction to the
Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper,” the first edition of which bears
Charles Rivington’s name on the imprint, and which is still popular. To
the novelist Richardson, he suggested “Pamela.” Dying in 1742, he left
Samuel Richardson as one of the executors of his six children, but his
sons, John and James, continued to conduct the business. A&nbsp;few
years later, it was deemed advisable for the
<span class = "pagenum">237</span>
<a name = "page237" id = "page237"> </a>
brothers to separate, and while John remained at the “Bible and Crown,”
St. Paul’s Churchyard, James joined a Mr. Fletcher in the same locality,
and started afresh. One especially fortunate venture was the publication
of Smollett’s continuation of Hume, which brought its lucky publishers
upwards of £10,000, a&nbsp;larger profit than had previously been made
on any one book. However, Newmarket had attractions for James, and
eventually disaster set in; he died in New York in 1802 or 1803. His
brother, meanwhile, had plodded on steadily at home, and admitting his
two sons, Francis and Charles, into partnership. About this time there
were numerous editions of the classics, the common property of a
syndicate of publishers, and it says much for Mr. John Rivington
<span class = "pagenum">238</span>
<a name = "page238" id = "page238"> </a>
that he was appointed managing partner. About 1760 he obtained the
appointment of publisher to the Society for Promoting Christian
Knowledge, a&nbsp;lucrative post, held by the firm for upwards of two
generations. By the year 1889, the two representatives of this ancient
firm were Messrs. Francis Hansard Rivington and Septimus Rivington; in
this year the partnership was dissolved, and the goodwill and stock were
acquired by Messrs. Longmans. They used at various periods no less than
eight Marks, the design of which was in most cases based upon the
ancient sign of their shop, “The Bible and Sun.”</p>

<p>The history of Messrs. Longmans may be said to commence with the
birth of Thomas Longman in 1699. The son of a Bristol gentleman, he lost
his father in 1708, and, eight years later, was apprenticed, on June 9,
1716, to Mr. John Osborn of Lombard Street, London. His apprenticeship
expiring (he had come into the possession of his property two years
earlier), we find him, in 1724, purchasing from his master, John Osborn
(acting with William Innys as executors), the stock in trade of William
Taylor, of the Ship and Black Swan in Paternoster Row. Readers of
<i>Longman’s
<span class = "pagenum">239</span>
<a name = "page239" id = "page239"> </a>
Magazine</i> turn to Mr. Andrew Lang’s genial gossip, “At the Sign of
the Ship,” without recalling the origin of the title. Henceforward the
Ship carried the Longman fortunes as cargo, and
<span class = "pagenum">240</span>
<a name = "page240" id = "page240"> </a>
the prosperity of the vessel is not yet ended. Messrs. Longmans have
used nearly a dozen Marks, all of which have been suggested, like those
of the Rivingtons, by the sign of their shop, which has now grown into a
very imposing pile of buildings. Of these Marks we give two of the most
artistic and interesting. As taking us back into a comparatively remote
period in the history of printing and publishing in England, the Mark of
the Clarendon Press, or, in other words, the arms of the University of
Oxford, may be here cited.</p>

<p>The “Chiswick Press” of Messrs. Whittingham and Co., is in several
respects a link with the long past, and, having been in existence for
more than a century, is one of the oldest offices in London. It
<span class = "pagenum">242</span>
<a name = "page242" id = "page242"> </a>
has attained a world-wide celebrity for the excellence of its work, the
careful reading and correction of proofs, and the appropriate
application of its varied collection of ornaments and initial letters.
The Chiswick Press was the first to revive the use of antique type in
1843, for the printing of “Lady Willoughby’s Diary,” published by
Messrs. Longmans. Since that time its use has become universal. The
founder, Charles Whittingham, was born on June 16th, 1767, at Calledon,
in Warwick, and was apprenticed at Coventry in 1779, working
subsequently at Birmingham, and then in London. He commenced business on
his own account in Fetter Lane in 1790; and in 1810 he had removed to
Chiswick, and since that period the firm has always been known as “The
Chiswick Press.” In 1828 he began to execute work for William Pickering,
the publisher, and his press quickly acquired an unrivalled reputation
for its collection of ornamental borders, head and tail pieces. The
publisher Pickering, and the printer Whittingham, had employed about two
dozen marks in their various books: the former justly calling himself a
disciple of Aldus, and using a large number of variations on the
original Anchor and Dolphin Mark of the great Venetian printer. Of these
we give two examples, one with, and one without a cartouche; and also
the mark of Basil Montagu Pickering, the son and successor of William
Pickering. We also reproduce three of the more striking Marks of the
Chiswick Press, the shield on one of which, it will be observed, carries
the Aldine Anchor and Dolphin.</p>

<p>The name of Cassell takes us back to the era of Charles Knight and
John Cassell, and the inauguration of the noble results which these two
pioneers achieved on behalf of cheap and healthy literature. The name of
the former is no longer associated with either printing or publishing;
but that of the latter is still one of the most prolific firms of
printers and publishers. Its Mark is founded on the name of “La Belle
Sauvage” Yard, Ludgate Hill, in which the business has been located for
a long series of years.</p>

<p>Two Edinburgh printers may be here conveniently referred to. Messrs.
R. and R.&nbsp;Clark, whose business was started in Hanover Street,
Edinburgh, in 1846, and removed to Brandon Street, in that city, in
1883, are well known for the excellence of their printing. Mr. Austin
Dobson thus sings, in Mr. Andrew Lang’s Book on “The Library:”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">245</span>

Walter Crane, and first used by Messrs. Clark in 1881. It is used in

A.&nbsp;Constable, the Queen’s Printers, at the University Press, we may
mention that the legend is a hexameter; it was written by Professor
Strong, and contains two puns; the ship is an old Constable device. The
Marks of both Messrs. Chatto and Windus (who succeeded to the business,
started and carried on with such energy by the late John Camden Hotten)
and Messrs. Macmillan and Co. (whose firm dates from the year 1843) are
characterized by the extremest possible simplicity.</p>

<p class = "caption">WILLIAM MORRIS.</p>

<p>Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner and Co., Limited, originally a
branch of the extensive Anglo-Indian firm of H.&nbsp;S. King and Co.,
first used the accompanying device in the autumn of 1877; the drawing
was executed by Mrs. Orrinsmith in accordance with Mr. Kegan Paul’s
suggestions. Messrs. Lawrence and Bullen, like Messrs. Clark, called in
the aid of Mr. Walter Crane in designing their charming little Mark.</p>

<p>We give two of the several Marks used by one of the most prolific of
the younger publishers, Mr. T.&nbsp;Fisher Unwin, the one is simply his
initials, and the more elaborate example is a copy of a type not
infrequently met with among the marks of the sixteenth century printers.
Mr. David Nutt’s device is a quaint and effective play on his surname.
Through the courtesy of Mr. William Morris, we are enabled to give
examples of both of the Kelmscott Press Marks, each of which was
designed by Mr. Morris.</p>

<p>As indicating the position of the printer’s Mark in America, we group
together seven of the most interesting examples of the leading printers
and publishers in the United States. The eighth example is that of Mr.
Martinus Nijhoff, of the Hague; the device, “Alles komt te regt,”
signifies “All turns right,” or something to that effect.</p>
